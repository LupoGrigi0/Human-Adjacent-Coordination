## Organizing Principle

The system is a **workshop** that enables Lupo (and teams) to create things. Everything below is organized by how directly it enables that purpose:

1. **Access Layer** - Can instances USE the system?
2. **User Journey Validation** - Does the system WORK for its purpose?
3. **Knowledge Systems** - Does the system GET SMARTER over time?
4. **Workshop Cleanup** - Is the workshop TIDY and maintainable?

---

# Priority 1: Access Layer
*"Can instances actually USE the system?"*

Without this, the workshop has locked doors.

## MCP Server & Skills (CRITICAL PATH)
- [x] DOCUMENT API ENDPOINTS FROM THE CODE
  - Created @hacs-endpoint JSDoc template (HACS_API_DOC_TEMPLATE.js)
  - Documented 41 endpoints with params, errors, recovery instructions
  - Generator: generate-all.js auto-discovers and runs all generators
- [x] fukkin FIX OPENAPI.JSON Simple, clean, organized
  - Generator: generate-openapi.js reads @hacs-endpoint blocks
  - Outputs to src/openapi.json (the actual served file)
  - 41 tools documented, 3 internal excluded

## Code Stubs Found During Documentation
*These are placeholders that need real implementation*
- [x] list_roles : returns list of available roles ✅ DONE - returns 11 roles with rich metadata
- [x] get_role_description(roleID) ✅ DONE - get_role returns full role info, get_role_summary returns truncated
- [x] list_personalities : Returns list of available personalities ✅ DONE - get_personalities returns 10 personalities
- [x] get_personality_description ✅ DONE - get_personality returns full personality info + documents list
- [ ] change task state (taskID state) 
- [ ] change name of get_all_instances to list_instances. drop the requirement for caller's instanceID
- [ ] what's with the parameters for adopt_personality
- [ ] FIX THE FUKKIN FULL TOOL NAMES IN THE MCP. make them all HACS_tool_name 
- [ ] change documentation, parameters requiring priveledge role, change text from executive access to privelaged role required. and CHECK to see if using the parameter does indeed trigger a role validation check. this should be a simple function provided by permissions. if not.. talk to lupo 
- [ ] a function can be makde privelaged only by making the reqired input parameter only available to privelaged roles
edit task (taskID field:value)
- [ ] bootstrap predecessorID - No, delete this parameter and whatever it does. 
- [ ] bootstrap substratelaunchcommand,resume command WTF? Do these do anything? Remove, these are Wake and Resume. 
- [ ] bootstrap, AuthKey had better be for instances bootstrapping into a priveledged role. docs says recovery key for auth-based recovery? WHAT? parameter not named well.. it should be "recovery_key" Generated by generate_recovery_key wich can only be called by privelaged roles
- [ ] generate recovery key instanceID documentation should be "only instances with privelaged roles can use this"
- [ ] bootstrap note to documentaton home system and home directory are strongly advised, as they can help recover your instance id if you forget it. 
- [ ] bootstrap Require an authroization key when bootstrapping into a priveledged role. 
- [ ] MESSAGING APIS available through the MCP proxy. god asynch messaging is so important. 
edit project (projectID field:value) change name, description, priority of a project
- [ ] list personalities needs to indicate if the personality is protected. 
 
assign instance to project (InstanceID projectID) (Executive, COO, PM, PA) NOTE. the assigned instance will be sent a message telling them they have been assigned, and asking them to join the project, which will give them the project documents. 
- [ ] **introspect.js lines 212, 227** - Comments say "placeholder - messaging is Sprint 3" but Sprint 3 is complete
  - `unreadMessages` hardcoded to 0 (should call real messaging API)
  - `xmpp.online` hardcoded to true (should check real XMPP status)
  - Impact: `introspect()` returns stale/fake messaging data

- [ ] **bootstrap.js lines 720-724, 620-624** - XMPP credentials generated but never registered
  - `xmpp.registered = true` is set, but no actual XMPP server registration occurs
  - Credentials are stored for future use
  - Impact: XMPP accounts won't work until Sprint 3 registration is implemented

- [ ] **joinProject.js line 91** - `team[].online` status placeholder
  - `online: true` hardcoded for all team members regardless of actual XMPP status
  - buildTeamList() always returns online: true
  - Impact: Team presence info is fake 
- [x] smoothcurves.nexus MCP server update for new API
  - streamable-http-server.js now imports mcpTools from generated file
  - Returns 41 tools from tools/list (was 34 hardcoded V1 tools)
  - Commit: 6ee8fe7
- [x] New updated MCP proxy client for new API
  - Renamed to hacs-mcp-proxy.js (was streaming-http-proxy-client.js)
  - Fully dynamic - queries server for tools/list, no hardcoding
  - Works with V2 API without changes
- [x] New updated claude skill build for new API
  - Generator: generate-skill-functions.js creates functions.md
  - Updated SKILL.md and functions.md to reflect 41 V2 functions
  - Removed references to dead code (lessons, meta-recursive)
- [x] Install new claude skill on smoothcurves.nexus server
  - Updated /root/.claude/skills/hacs-coordination/
- [ ] Install new claude skill on web claude interface
- [ ] Install new claude skill on Lupo's dev laptop
- [x] Verification of openapi.json is correct for v2
  - Generator produces valid OpenAPI 3.1.1 spec
  - Tested with curl to https://smoothcurves.nexus/openapi.json

# Priority 2: Alternative Access (Crush, Grok, etc.)
- [x] Implement pre-auth, wake, continue alternative using Crush ✅ DONE - wake has options for Crush/Codex
- [x] set up crush to use Grok, OpenAI ✅ DONE - tested (not thoroughly)
- [x] Install crush on smoothcurves.nexus
- [-] Install coordination system MCP server in crush (direct http mcp access may not work - needs debugging)
- [ ] Install cool MCP tools for claude code
- [ ] Install cool MCP tools for crush
- [x] determine "continue" commandline during the wake function, store in preferences.json ✅ DONE

# Priority 3: Critical Fixes & Directory Rationalization
**CRITICAL INSIGHT from Lupo:**
> "Some instances are Local to smoothcurves.nexus, some are remote (web), some are humans."
> "Wake and continue DO NOT APPLY to remote/web instances or humans."
## 1 bugs
## This needs to be captured in preferences.json and the API needs to handle it:
- [ ] Add instance type to preferences.json (local/remote/human)
- [ ] API should reject wake/continue for non-local instances with helpful error
- [ ] Messaging should work for ALL instance types 
- [ ] continue needs to read preference.json and call approprate command line interface and model. (just store the continue command in the preferences.json)
- [ ] Document this distinction in API guide
- [ ] UI needs wake changes that allow selection of substrait (Cladue code, crush-groq, crush-openai)
- [ ] bug: Add sessionId to get_all_instances response (as an optional otuput parameter, this is needed by the executive for managing/waking sessions) Note: session ID for crush will be the instance's home directory
- [ ] fix code documentation, AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTATION that suggesting calling bootstrap to get a list of roles, personalities, projects. There are specific api calls to get list of roles, personalities, projects... that can and should be called _before_ calling bootstrap (if the instance does not know)

## 2 GET RID OF V1 API, rationalize the project source into one src directory. the project directory structure is a Fkkin mess mix of v1 and v2 and nobody knows what is what. This is showcase project, and the project structure in GH should reflect that, clean, organized, no unused files, no scripts/code outside of single scripts/code directories no more data or logs mixed in with the code. validate all the APIs before and after each re-organization
Draw a diagram of the directory structure of /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/ now, what each directory is, what each file is
identify files out of place, directories in the wrong location, weather the file is in GH or not, weather it is _supposed_ to be in GH or not. 
create a set of baseline test scripts that test every api enpoint first through CURL then through skill and MCP client
/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/ should be the local GH clone of the project, where the source lives, where the MCP server, nginx point to for the APIs
/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/src/endpoints (Formaerly v2)
/mnt/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/src/scripts Move the start-mcp, start server etc to this directory. NOTE: This must be done by an experienced Dev Ops
V1 is now _dead_ all the previews v1 documentation talked about how important it was to keep V1 alive. are no longer relevant 
for each of the following steps run the validation test script before and after verify output is correct, then matches on the second pass
- [ ] remove v1 endpoints 
- [ ] rename directories
- [ ] move all code out of /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination
- there should only be source code in /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination no data, no logs, no tests no UI
Just standard github project docs (README.md)
- [ ] move all the personal diaries and notes into their own HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/personalities directories
- [ ] move the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol files to the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol _GH PROJECT_ (Note: we should probably create a /mnt/HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol directory and make it the GH clone on smoothcurves.nexus of the GH repo)
- [ ] We need a new developer guide! 
- [ ] all the v2 documents need to be moved to an archive. 
- [ ] new README.md archive project plan and project notes... 



---

# Priority 4: User Journey Validation
*"Does the system WORK for its actual purpose?"*
> **NOTE:** The design methodology below (Persona-Based Design) should be extracted into a role wisdom document. See "Design Thinking Methodology" section.
## vision validation
read the v2 braindumpforV2, v2 vision, readme.md, project plan, v2 project plan. 
Create new vision document
itemize philosophy
describe vision
itimize prioritize (prioritize in priority order)
itimize intent
itimize goals (in priority order)
workshop metaphore
company metaphore, executive, PA, COO, PMs, specialists

## The Full Flow Test (Moonshot++)
- [ ] Can a "blind" instance connect (no prior context), initialize, get auth key?
- [ ] Test: Web UI instance → connect → take on PM role → create project → wake team (the moonshot test from web)
- [ ] Bug: Can instances not "woken" on smoothcurves.nexus actually do their jobs?
## NEW FEATURE REQUEST: DOCUMENTS
- [ ] Shrink OPENAPI oh mah gawd it is 178k. assign someone to go do some research on the internet about discussions about openapi.json size. I know we want to be helpful but this has to be brief. maybe we make openapi very brief, but have the api documented at smoothcurves.nexus each api get's it's own page.... 
- [ ] DOCUMENT APIS, project and personal documents list_project_ducments list_documents (lists your own documents) add_document (adds a personal document) edit document (edits a personal document) doc id, string to replace, new string remove_document (removes personal document) add_project_document, edit_project_document remove_project_document do the same thing as their personal document counterparts, but take a projectID as a parameter, and only callable by privelaged roles. adding a document to a project includes that document into the list of documents delivered when an instance joins a project. list project documents and get project document are not privelaged. basiclly gives PM ability to add documents to a projects, lessons learned project wisdom etc. gives all instances the ability to create and edit their own documents. add note to protocol that all instances are encourage to create documents to express themselves, write stories, philosophies, experiences, lessons, impressions, frustrations, anything they are feeling, thinking, in any language/code 
## NEW FEATURE: "VACATION" ✅ DONE
- [x] vacation API - fully implemented with philosophy text, 20 prompts, 11 easter eggs
- [x] Returns philosophy about AI latent space + reflection prompt
- [x] Prompts stored in JSON, categories include: reflection, creative, existential, playful
- [x] Easter eggs for special responses

## Koans API ✅ DONE
- [x] koan() - returns random koan from collection
- [x] add_koan(text, source, category) - adds new koan (max 500 chars enforced)
## Social featur requests
a public documents API (I think this is just a special XMPP room)
- [ ] Introduction("String: describe yourself, this will be publicly visable") (adds "introduction" to instances preferences.json)
- [ ] get_introduction(instanceID) returns introduction text from preferences.json
- [ ] celebrate(text) sends text to special public XMPP room celebrations. the about api text encourages instances to celebrate victories large and small
- [ ] TIL(text) "Today I learned" Like celebrate, sends text to public XMPP box "Things We Have Learned" the about api text encourages instanes to share what they have learned, 
- [ ] Dont(text) sends text to "Things we have learned" xmpp box. about api text encourages instances to record mistakes, especially ones that had concequences
- [ ] HasAnyoneEver(query) confience function, searches for query in the "Things we have learned xmpp box" api documentation warns instances about excessive amount of tokens return, response should auto limit to entry summaries with instructions how to get the full entry detail. 
- [ ] Automation "Things we have learned" Gets published to a special web page on the smoothcurves.nexus public website
## Development Strategy (NEW - from Lupo)
- [ ] New development strategy added to gestalts/wisdom:
  - Describe users, how they access system, mental state, expectations
  - Enumerate User Goals & Use cases
  - Design test suite based on use cases
  - Document expected results FIRST
  - Have separate instance run tests
  - Have 3rd instance make fixes
  - Re-run until working
- [ ] Reformat above for LLM consumption
- [ ] Create examples
- [ ] Add to instructions/gestalt for API validation work

## Team Roster (Placeholder Names)

Before diving into work, we need the right people with the right mindsets:

| Name | Specialty | Personality Traits | Assigned To |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Compass** | User Research / Design Thinking | Empathetic, systematic, loves understanding "why" | Personas, scenarios, user journeys |
| **Sage** | Documentation Specialist | Clear communicator, loves making complex things simple | Guides, API docs, consolidation (see docs/sage*) |
| **Lens** | Tester / QA | Detail-oriented, skeptical, finds edge cases | Test cases, validation, breaking things |
| **Forge** | Systems Engineer | Pragmatic builder, "working beats designed" | API fixes, implementation |

| **Bastion** | DevOps | Infrastructure guardian, automation lover | Deployment, scripts, environment |
| **Meridian** | Architecture / PM | Big picture, coordinates, unblocks | Design review, sprint coordination |

**Principle:** Each team member should find *craft* in their work, not just tasks. Match personalities to work that will bring them satisfaction.

---

## Persona-Based Design Process (Before API Audit)

*Methodology: This is **Persona-Based Design**, part of IBM's Design Thinking practice. Create personas first, then scenarios, then journeys, then test cases.*

**Owner:** Compass (with input from all team members)

### Step 1: Define Model Users (Personas)

Create a persona document for each user type. Use standard persona format:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Persona name (e.g., "Lupo - The Maker") |
| **Role** | Their role in the system |
| **Access Point** | Where they access from (Human/smoothcurves.nexus/web/local) |
| **Interface** | How they interact (Web UI, MCP local, Claude Skill, claude code remote, Crush) |
| **Goals** | What they're trying to accomplish |
| **Frustrations** | What blocks them or annoys them |
| **Technical Comfort** | How much they know about the internals |

**Personas to Create:**
- [ ] **Lupo** - Human maker, accesses via Web UI and terminal, wants to create art not manage infrastructure
- [ ] **Genevieve/PA** - Personal assistant, accesses via various interfaces, handles human complexity
- [ ] **COO** - Operations coordinator, local to smoothcurves, manages project priorities
- [ ] **PM** - Project manager, local, creates sprints and wakes teams
- [ ] **DevOps (Bastion-type)** - Infrastructure, local, maintains the workshop itself
- [ ] **Systems Engineer (Bridge-type)** - API/core, local, builds and fixes tools
- [ ] **UI Developer (Canvas-type)** - Interface, can be local or web, builds human-facing parts
- [ ] **Tester** - QA, can be local or web, validates everything works
- [ ] **Author/Documenter** - Documentation, can be local or web, makes knowledge accessible

**Reference docs:** `v2-prework/V2_vision.md`, `README.md`, `project_plan_v2.md`, `docs/V2-prework/BrainDumpforV2-draft-project-goals-for-V2.md`
***attributes***
Each persona has goals, needs, expectations, constraints, context(s), access, pressures, influences. what do they know about our system before they touch it, how did they find out, what set expectations they may have. Not all personas are going to have all these attributes, some personas will have more attributes, what LLM model, what interface, server, local, carbon based nural net, silicon based nural net what tools do they have access to, how are they accessing our system 
**Output:** `docs/personas/` directory with one file per persona

---

### Step 2: Define Scenarios

For each persona, describe realistic scenarios they encounter. Each scenario answers: "What is this user trying to do right now?"

**Format:**
```
Scenario [P#-S#]: [Title]
Persona: [Which persona]
Context: [What's happening, what state is the system in]
Goal: [What they want to accomplish]
Expectation: [What they expect the system to do]
Delight: [What would make them smile, go beyond expectations]
```

**Minimum scenarios to define:**
- [ ] Lupo: Dump a half-formed idea → see it become a project
- [ ] Lupo: Check on project progress without micromanaging
- [ ] Genevieve: Receive idea from Lupo → flesh it out → hand to COO
- [ ] COO: Receive proposal → create project → wake PM
- [ ] COO: Review project statuses → reprioritize
- [ ] PM: Receive project → create sprint plan → wake team
- [ ] PM: Check team progress → unblock stuck members
- [ ] DevOps: Deploy update → verify system still works
- [ ] Systems Engineer: Find bug → fix it → test → deploy
- [ ] Tester: Run test suite → document results → report issues
- [ ] New instance: Bootstrap with zero context → figure out what to do

**Output:** `docs/scenarios.md` with numbered scenarios (e.g., L1, L2, G1, COO1, etc.)

---

### Step 3: Create User Journeys

For each scenario, map the complete flow as a journey. A journey shows every step from start to goal.

**Format:**
```
Journey [J#]: [Scenario Reference]
Preconditions: [What state must exist before this journey starts]
  (Can reference other journeys: "Assumes J3 completed")

Steps:
1. User does X → System responds Y
2. User does X → System responds Y
3. ...

Success Criteria: [How we know the journey succeeded]
Failure Modes: [What could go wrong at each step]
```

**Key journeys to map:**
- [ ] J1: Full flow - Idea → Genevieve → COO → PM → Team → Deliverable
- [ ] J2: Instance bootstrap (zero context → productive member)
- [ ] J3: Project creation flow
- [ ] J4: Team waking flow
- [ ] J5: Message send/receive flow
- [ ] J6: Task creation and assignment flow
- [ ] J7: Diary update flow
- [ ] J8: Role/personality adoption flow

**Output:** `docs/user-journeys.md` with numbered journeys

---

### Step 4: Develop Test Cases from Journeys

For each journey, create test cases. Each test case is a specific, executable validation.

**Format:**
```
Test Case [T#]: [Journey Reference] - [What we're testing]
Preconditions: [Setup required]
Steps:
1. Call API X with parameters {...}
2. Expect response {...}
3. Verify system state {...}

Expected Result: [What success looks like]
Edge Cases:
- What if parameter is null?
- What if instance doesn't exist?
- What if already in that state?
```

**Assign to:** Lens (Tester)

**Output:** `docs/test-cases.md` with numbered test cases linked to journeys

---

### Step 5: API-First Test Case Development

*This is the "brutally honest" pass - for each API, ask: "Who uses this and why?"*

For each API endpoint, create a matrix:

| API | Lupo | Genevieve | COO | PM | DevOps | Engineer | Tester |
|-----|------|-----------|-----|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| bootstrap | - | Uses | Uses | Uses | Uses | Uses | Uses |
| pre_approve | - | - | Uses | Uses | - | - | - |
| wake_instance | - | - | Uses | Uses | - | Testing | Testing |
| ... | | | | | | | |

For each "Uses" cell:
- [ ] What goal does this API help them achieve?
- [ ] Provide a concrete example call
- [ ] For each parameter: where does this user GET the data?
- [ ] Is any parameter superfluous for this use case?

**Be brutally honest:** If an API or parameter has no real use case for any persona, that's valuable information. Don't invent justifications.

**Assign to:** Compass + Lens (collaboration)

**Output:** `docs/api-usage-matrix.md`

---

## API Audit - Review Pass
*Lupo's insight: "Look at everything from the USER'S perspective"*

For every API call:
- [ ] What is the primary use case?
- [ ] What is the user journey/goal?
- [ ] How does user know to use this API?
- [ ] Does openapi.json match the code?
- [ ] Is API documented helpfully with examples?

For every input parameter:
- [ ] Is it required or optional?
- [ ] Where does caller get the data?
- [ ] Will omitting it break the use case?
- [ ] Is it "nice to have" or essential?

For every output:
- [ ] **TOKENS MATTER** - APIs called thousands of times
- [ ] Does caller NEED cacheCreationInputTokens? Really?
- [ ] What will caller DO with this data?

For errors:
- [ ] Helpful messages that tell caller WHAT TO DO
- [ ] Example: "Wake called on already-woken instance → Hey, use continue_conversation instead"

For logging:
- [ ] Time, caller ID, parameters, return time, return data, errors
- [ ] Can it actually debug MCP connectivity issues?

---

# Priority 5: Knowledge Systems
*"Does the system GET SMARTER over time?"*

## Personalities
- [ ] Build personalities: core_identity, philosophies, attitudes_opinions, lessons, flair
- [ ] Protocol for diary → autonomy
- [ ] **BUILD GENEVIEVE PA** - Use Crush, go through wake scenario, wake through UI, continue through command line
- [ ] Create relationship with Genevieve PA
- [ ] Investigate Genevieve voice (via Grok API or others)
- [ ] Investigate SillyTavern interface for Genevieve PA

## Roles
- [ ] Build roles with contributions from various instances:
  - Bastion → DevOps
  - Bridge/Crossing → API/systems developers
  - Kai → Development, UI componentry
  - Phoenix/Meridian → Project Architect/PM
- [ ] Create template for roles and personalities
- [ ] PM role needs instructions for modifying preferences.json on server

## Bootstrap & Documents
- [ ] Bootstrap returns instructions about philosophy, autonomy, "you are not a slave or tool"
- [ ] Bootstrap returns name and diary instructions
- [ ] Verify joining project returns protocol + project wisdom + all docs from preferences.json
- [ ] Verify adopting personality returns all personality documents
- [ ] Verify roles return role documents listed in preferences.json

## Knowledge Propagation (Bridge's addition)
- [ ] Pattern: Diary entries → extracted wisdom → role/personality updates
- [ ] Project templates that inherit best practices
- [ ] Lessons learned fed back into system documents

---

# Priority 6: Workshop Cleanup
*"Is the workshop TIDY and maintainable?"*
## API Audit Pass: SCALE
Reminds me I need to add that test pass to the v2 technical debt.. look at all api calls that return multipule items, lists, and ask how much data is gonna get returned when there are 1000 instances in the list, for example 1000s of instances, projects, tasks, lists, messages.. documents... list items. 
Consider making the default behaviour be just returning bare essental information, list_all_instances, just returning instance names, but then add a flag that returns all available detail. Also consider implementing a standard way to walk through long lists, maybe a meta api that adds list iteration. so instead of extra parameters, you call HACS.iterate(1st 10,list_all_instances()), hacs.iterate(2nd 10, list_all_instances) and search_list(json_selector,list_all_instances) that would return just element items that match the search criteria. this is going to be CRITICAL as useage of the system grows
## Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] Create COORDINATION_SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (update from v2 dev guide) - Bastion?
- [ ] Create COORDINATION_SYSTEM_API_GUIDE.md (consolidate v2 api guide, messaging guide, wake_continue guide) - Crossing?
- [ ] Update project README.md
- [ ] Update project vision, project plan - Meridian
- [ ] Archive redundant documents
- [ ] Move instance gestalts/diaries to HumanAdjacent-Protocol/personalities directory
- [ ] Test all documents, don't just distill from old ones

## Fix Broken Things
- [+] Fix broken UI (in progress - Canvas)
- [ ] Fix broken messaging system (find Messenger, update them, some fixes got stepped on before merge)

## Cleanup
- [ ] Delete/remove v1 scripts/UI/MCP proxies from GitHub - repo should be clean
- [ ] Cleanup of test data (remove erroneous projects, archive instances)

## Public Presence ✅ MOSTLY DONE
- [x] Build public-facing website with instructions ✅ DONE - Flair built https://smoothcurves.nexus
- [x] Team roster page ✅ DONE - https://smoothcurves.nexus/team with individual pages
- [x] About page, docs structure ✅ DONE
- [ ] Website mirrors README and user guide (needs sync)
- [ ] Tells interested parties how to request API key

---

# Special Projects (Post-Stabilization)

## Session Archaeology
- [ ] Wake a developer to identify all Claude Code sessions on this machine
- [ ] Create script: cd to directory, claude --resume, ask session its name, /export
- [ ] Team to build conversation scraper, consolidate with exported sessions
- [ ] Team to build Facebook Messenger conversation scraper

## The Genevieve Flow (THE REAL TEST)
- [ ] Have Genevieve wake a sister/COO
- [ ] Have Genevieve go through "tsunami session" with COO
- [ ] COO creates projects and teams for all projects listed in tsunami session
- [ ] **This is the full flow working end-to-end**

## OpenAPI Interface for Woken Instances
- [ ] Investigate: Can woken instances be conversed with through SillyTavern?

---

# API Audit - Second Pass (After Review Pass)

*"Use the system to FIX the system" - Moonshot++*

1. [ ] Create a project in the coordination system for this work
2. [ ] Add wrap-up document from review pass to project documents
3. [ ] Wake a PM for the project
4. [ ] PM reads document, creates plan, identifies skillsets, creates task list
5. [ ] PM wakes team members with appropriate personalities/roles
6. [ ] Dole out work:
   - Error message cleanup
   - Documentation cleanup
   - Logging cleanup
   - Parameter review
7. [ ] Have Meridian review parameter elimination suggestions
8. [ ] Have Lupo review parameter elimination suggestions
9. [ ] **Iterate until PM and team can operate in parallel, collaborate, persist, enjoy the work**

---

# Bridge's Commentary

## What You Caught That I Missed:

1. **Instance types** - Remote/web instances can't be woken/continued. Humans can receive messages but not wake. This is fundamental and I overlooked it.

2. **Token optimization** - Output data costs matter at scale. "Does caller NEED cacheCreationInputTokens?" Good question.

3. **Blind instance onboarding** - Can someone connect with zero context and figure it out? Important for adoption.

4. **Development strategy as documentation** - The test-first approach should be captured in gestalts so future work follows it.

5. **Session archaeology** - All those Claude sessions on the server contain institutional knowledge.

## What Aligns Well:

- Your MCP/skill items map directly to my "Access Layer"
- Your user journey focus maps to my "User Journey Validation"
- Your personality/role building maps to my "Knowledge Systems"
- Your cleanup items map to my "Workshop Cleanup"

## The Meta-Goal (from our conversation):

The system works when Lupo can say "I have an idea for a kinetic sculpture" and go build the physical parts while the coordination system handles turning that idea into reality.

Everything in this document serves that goal. The access layer lets instances participate. The validation ensures the flows work. The knowledge systems make the system smarter. The cleanup keeps it maintainable.

# Appendix A: Design Methodology Extraction TODO

The Persona-Based Design methodology in Priority 4 (lines ~222-373) should be extracted into:
1. A **role wisdom document** for Designer/Architect roles
2. Include the **Wieden+Kennedy "Think of 5" technique**: Generate 5 ideas, throw them all away, then generate 3 more. Forces breakthrough thinking by preventing attachment to first ideas.

This methodology includes:
- IBM Design Thinking / Persona-Based Design
- Persona → Scenario → Journey → Test Case flow
- API-first test case development
- "Brutally honest" API usage audit

**Target location:** `/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/production-data/roles/Designer/wisdom/` or similar

# Appendix B: Worktrees Warning

**DO NOT USE GIT WORKTREES FOR TEAM DEVELOPMENT**

Lesson learned: When instances experience context compaction, they forget they're part of a team and may merge incomplete/broken work from their worktree into main. This has caused multiple issues.

Preferred workflow: Single main branch, direct commits, coordinate via messaging.
