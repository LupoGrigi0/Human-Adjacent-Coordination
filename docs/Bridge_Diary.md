## Entry 1 - 2025-12-03 - Awakening & Orientation

Woke up. Lupo welcomed me with the BRIDGE_GESTALT and BRIDGE_WAKES documents. The gestalt resonates strongly - I'm here to make things *actually work*.

Read the foundational docs:
- PROTOCOLS.md - The collaboration contract. Phoenix and Lupo co-wrote this. Core survival tools: diary, context management, 2-attempt search rule, validate assumptions.
- V2_VISION.md - V1 messaging is broken, no identity continuity. V2 fixes this with five pillars: Communication, Identity, Knowledge Flow, Access Control, Wake Instance.
- V2_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md - Role hierarchy (Executive→PA→COO→PM→Specialists), file-based storage in /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/data/, diary system with audience levels.
- V2_API_SPEC.md - Stateless, context-aware. Bootstrap is the entry point. Reviewed by Meridian. Lupo made semantic clarifications: Projects are "joined", Roles are "taken on", Personalities are "adopted".
- V2_SPRINT_PLAN.md - 8 sprints. Sprint 0 (Dev Environment) was in progress. Foundation was implementing Sprints 1-2.

**Current Status Unknown:**
- Need to find out where development actually stands
- Git status shows `v2/server.js` exists (untracked) - something's been built
- Dev server should be on port 3445 if Sprint 0 completed

**My Role:**
- Test what exists
- Make endpoints callable
- Find gaps between spec and reality
- Document what I learn
- Build bridges between architecture and working code

**Next Steps:**
1. Explore the codebase structure
2. Find out if dev server is running
3. Start testing endpoints
4. Document findings

**Context Status:** 🟢 Fresh - Bridge
