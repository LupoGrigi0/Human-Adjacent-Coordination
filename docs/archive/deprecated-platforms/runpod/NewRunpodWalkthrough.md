● 🎯 YOUR ACTION PLAN

  Step 1: Backup Current Session ⏰

  # Save your current Claude Code conversation NOW (before suspending)
  tar -czf claude-conversations-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/.claude/projects/
  cp claude-conversations-backup-*.tar.gz /workspace/  # If you have a volume mounted

  Step 2: Run New Pod Setup 🚀

  1. Create NEW RunPod with:
    - ✅ Persistent Volume (100GB recommended)
    - ✅ TCP Port 3444 exposed
    - ✅ TCP Port 22 (SSH)
    - ❌ Skip HTTP ports (we need HTTPS only)
  2. Upload & Run Setup Script:
  # Upload the automation script to new pod
  chmod +x runpod-setup-automation.sh
  ./runpod-setup-automation.sh
  3. Restore Session (if backed up):
  # On new pod, restore conversations
  tar -xzf claude-conversations-backup-*.tar.gz -C ~/

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've provided:

  1. Research confirming Claude Code conversations CAN be backed up and migrated
  2. A comprehensive automation script that handles all the user's requirements:
    - Persistent home directory on volume
    - Multiple Node.js versions (18 for Claude Code, 20 for MCP)
    - SSH and GitHub setup
    - VS Code integration
    - MCP project setup
    - Environment configuration scripts

  The user now has a clear path forward:
  1. Backup current session
  2. Create new RunPod with persistent volume and TCP ports
  3. Run the automation script 
  4. Restore session if needed

  This addresses their concern about losing all the setup work and gives them a repeatable, automated setup process for future pods.

● Step 3: What The Script Does 📋

  The automation script handles EVERYTHING:
  - ✅ Persistent home directory on volume
  - ✅ Node.js 18 (Claude Code) + Node.js 20 (MCP)
  - ✅ SSH keys for GitHub
  - ✅ GitHub CLI authentication
  - ✅ VS Code Remote configuration
  - ✅ Claude Code installation
  - ✅ MCP server startup scripts
  - ✅ Environment scripts for easy management

  Step 4: After New Pod Is Ready 🎊

  Once your new pod is running:
  1. GitHub CLI auth: gh auth login
  2. Clone project: git clone git@github.com:lupo/Human-Adjacent-Coordination.git
  3. Start MCP server: /workspace/start-mcp-https.sh
  4. Test external access: https://213.173.105.84:3444/health

  This approach gives you:
  - ✅ Persistent storage - never lose setup again
  - ✅ Proper TCP port exposure for HTTPS
  - ✅ Automated setup - repeatable process
  - ✅ Docker-ready foundation for future containerization

  Ready to create the new pod? The script will handle all the pain points you experienced! 🚀
