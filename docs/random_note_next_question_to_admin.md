hey.. here is a thought. I think if you do a quick google
  search you will find that digital ocean has an MCP, and i
  think we can install a local MCP proxy client so you could
  .. i dunno .. check the status of our drople and storage? \
  This idea came up because another project, a portfolio
  website... is going to need a server to run on. I have a
  volume provisioned in digital ocean for it's storage
  (/mnt/lupoportfolio) and the webiste's infrastrcture is
  containerized already. your counterpart is suggesting
  pointing smoothcurves.art and smoothcurves.love to this
  droples ip address and configuring nginx to proxy to local
  docker instances that run the website's infrastrcutre.
