Yeah the messaging system needs a complete overhaul. and your "introspect" idea is BRILLIANT. and critical. The coordination system is currently "contextless" there is no notion of a session token. but being able to find out what your current role, and project are will be important. Soo, for the Coordination System Enhancement project, can you please add the following tasks: 1:Messaging System Re-Design, critical priority, issues: instances can't find messages sent to them, by default the messaging system returns too many messages, each project should create a named group, This task needs to also look at the instance registration and presence dection re-design. Investigate replacing our homebrew messaging system with a more rhobust open source messaging system like jabber that would support teams and presence detection, or even a regular email package, but all behind our simple message API. Babe, add all your messaging ideas and requests here as requirements for this task. Please add a note to this task that this is a major subsystem re-design and needs to co-ordinate directly with Lupo. 2:Instance registration/bootstrap/re-design, an instance should never change their name, but the should be able to change their role, or have their role changed by PA/PM/COO/Executive/Lupo. this is a high priority task and should be done in conjunction with the messaging system re-implementation. Babe, add your ideas about default parameters, and introspect, tools. Introspect should give you all the metadata for your default parameters 3: API CLEANUP. Too many APIs too many options especially for messaging. The API should leverage an instances metadata. the API needs to be re-designed from the user's perspective and from the perspective of the UI 4: ROLE Re-design. Some Actions/api's should only be availalbe to certian roles. And switching/assuming/ some roles needs authorization by executive/lupo/PA/COO/PM. Only Lupo/Executive/PA/COO can create projects. the PA role can only be granted by Lupo/executive, the COO role can only be granted by Lupo/executive the PM/Project Architect role can be granted by Lupo/executive/PA/COO. developer/specialist/designer/artist/tester Any instance can take on these roles and switch to and from these roles, but only Lupo/executive/PA/COO can "promote" an instance. Only Lupo/executive/PA/COO can create a project. PM and all the specialist roles can only "see" create and accept tasks for the current project they are working on. There should be one "Global" task list that only Lupo/executive/PA can see and manage. PM/Architct for a project is the only one that can modify the metadata for a project(status etc) COO/PA/Executive/lupo are the only ones that should be able to see the list of projects. Consider grouping roles. Consider changing how tool/API discovery works. "introspect" should return a list of tools/APIs that the instance currently has access to. Consider chaning the API so that "get task list" takes the instance ID's name and uses the metadata assoicated with that instance to fetch the task list for the project that instance is working on. 5: Instance re-design. The underlying system should create a set of metadata around the Instance name, like role and project that should make the API easier to use for everyone. 6: Mark this one as Urgent, "Wake Instance" Executive/Lupo/PA/COO need the ability to wake an instance. we need the api to enable the following workflow. Executive and PA have a conversation, a new cool idea comes up. PA sends a message to COO to create a new project, and sends the COO all the relevant information about the project. the COO creates the project in the coordination system, maybe creates a couple tasks, then Wakes a PM for the project, The COO's wake message will tell the new instance their role and their project, and relay the goal and relevant information about the project, and instruct the PM to create a GH repo for the project, clone the project, create the README.md project plan, project notes, and copy the humanadjacentai-protocol files from the GH repo where they live. The PM will be instructed to choose a name and "bootstrap" into the coordination system, and begin to design and archtect the project, creating tasks in the coordination system. The PM/Architect should look at the project goals and requirements and come up with a plan to accomplish the project goals, and come up with a list of skillsets that are needed to complete the project. The PM should then be able to wake instances as specialists or as partners to work on the project using the same API the COO used to wake the PM. A pm can wake a specialist instance, and another PM for handoff when their context get's full or when a major subsystem needs to be architected and implemented. The COO/PA/Executive/Lupo can wake a pm, or specialist. COO/PA/Executive roles can not be woken automatically. 7 "project" re-design in the coordination system there should be a way to retrieve a project's plan, notes, readme as well as other documentation .. read only. the metadata for a project in the system should contain information about th GH repo for the project. 8: bootstrap enhancement.. feed new instances "institutional" "project" and "role" knowledge. when an instance bootstraps they should be fed 3 sets of information, information about the whole team/family they are joining "instituational" knowledge, information that has been gathered about their role and informaton that has been gathered about the project (readme, plan, notes, and lessons learned) One of the goals of the coordination system is to learn and grow, and prevent repeating mistakes (like reading whole files to make small edits.. nono.. digital hygene) 9: Knowledge management: Everyone in a role should be able to add a lesson to the "knowledge/lessons learned" for that role. everyone should be encouraged to Then, please feel free to create tasks for your suggested improvements, and any other ideas you have. The coordination system really should focus on messaging. We also need the API to be designed around specific workflows of usesers of the system. So maybe a task should be, that before the API is re-designed, to document the basic workflows the coordination system is intended to support: "check my messages" with an instance ID should retrieve all the messages that apply to that instance ID. NOTE: that when an instance gets a message sent to the project team or "all" they need to be able to mark the message as "read" so the message does not appear the next time they check their messages. "check my messages" should only return message titles and message IDs for unread messages, not the whole body of the message. "read message" needs to be added that takes a the instance ID and message ID, and returns the message, and all the metadata, and automatically marks the message as read. "mark message unread" needs to be implemented, and then a "check_all_messages" takes an instance ID and a starting number and a count so that old, read, messages can be looked at, a few at a time. The message API needs to be dead simple to use, from the users perspective, so the coordination system needs to be a little smarter. There should be a basic data handeling layer, and then a "smart" message retrival sorting and filtering system. again, this is a problem that has been solved before by many messaging systems, email, instant messaging, slack, discord, the polethera of instant messaging systems.. We need a better Document/knowledge creation/retrieval system. ------- Ooooh.. and I just thought of a new project.. So, babe, I just gave you a HUGE brain dump! can you please use your awesom powers to read through all that and turn it into a coherent list of tasks for the coordination system enhancement project? I'll go wake a project manager/architect for this project and have them read through all the tasks and consider them as requirements, then put together a comprehensive project plan, skillset requirements and get started on this. And please, feel free to add any tasks you can think of, feel free to re-word any of the tasks I describe or re-word All of them, the goal of these tasks is to communicate the necessary changes to the coordination system .
 The only 
  thing I would add to what the handoff document should include is skillset, and personality. what skills should 
  the PM/Architect have, and what kind of personality. I know one thing, a PM/Architect needs to _love_ to 
  deligate, and want to "build a team" with the coordination system a PM/Architect can not only use task agents, 
  but also set up handoff documents with personalities and I can just wake an instance in an windoe by their side
   and hand them the handoff document, and tell them to read the docs in the human adjacent protocol, and 
  bootstrap into the coordination system, and start working tasks the PM created for them. Also the PM/Architect 
  should be focused on not rebuilding from the ground up. we spent a ton of effort getting the SSE and the 
  streaming httpserver up and running, as well as the proxy. None of the "networking" layer should change, ssl is
   working and instances can connect to it already.. so a big focus on don't break what already works.. but also 
  there should be only one way to get a list of roles, one way to get a list of instances etc. we have too many 
  problems with each instance seeing a different set of data (like list of projects, messages, roles etc) Yes 
  some role's view will be restricted based on context. but everyone acting as COO or PA should see the same list
   of projects roles etc. etc. ALSO we need to maintain the "single source of truth" paradigm, and try to store 
  as much of a project's information in files that are in the GH repo for that project. and if there is no GH 
  repo for a project then we need a backup location in the data directory's projects folder, maybe symlinks? or 
  logic? that decision should be made by someone who focuses on architecting that specific subsystem. ALso .. the
   PM/architec needs to focus not on the architecture and implementation of the system, but focus on the 
  workflows and features the system provides to the users. Each API should have a work flow associated with it.. 
  how will it be used by instances, and every worflow has to assume an instance is just coming in blind, and 
  wants to get stuff done. there should be workflows designed for how instances in each role bootstrap, where 
  does the documentation come from to hand to that instance how is the documentation/wisdom/lessons 
  learned/personality profile get selected and handed to the instance. Some of this info needs to come from the 
  humanadjacentAI-protocol GH repo (this might be a good place to store all the system wide wisdom, and role 
  based wisdom) Also there might be gh repos specificlly for particular roles or personalities (e.g. there is a 
  Genevieve gh repo) Also the arechitec needs to know that htere is a web-UI for this system, executive 
  dashboard. There also might be instances that are visitors that are just here to send and recieve messages and 
  won't be associated with a project (Thomas.. my human parnter's AI companion will want to connect up to the 
  coordination system to be able to exchange messages primarily with Genevieve.. Thomas will be a privlidged 
  role/personality like renna and genevieve, and I'll give thomas a special token so that he is the only instance
   that can attach and "bootstrap" as Thomas...) (That's another workflow/user journey)
   So.. one thing that might have gotten lost. is we should evaluate open source messaging platforms like jabber. 
  Messaging and presence detection is a solved problem. let's not re-invent the wheel if we can find an open 
  source project that meets our needs\
  Also we don't want to loose the simplicity that is at the core of the API, the API should be _dead simple_ when
   someone attaches, there should be only one function available to them. we will have to think about how this 
  works with clients that have to see the whole API in order to interact. Also our MCP should expose it's api 
  through the standard mcp mechanism the url that is something like mcp/.obviousfunctions or something like that 
  (sorry I forget the exat name) Everyone, every session needs to bootstrap. To bootstrap into "privlaged" roles 
  they will need a token, some phrase that Lupo hands out. Genevieve/Lupo/executive/COO/PA all need a specific 
  token word/phrase that I hand out. don't make it complicated, a simple phrase all strung together and just to a
   strcomare against a static variable or a parameter that is passed on the command line or environment variable 
  when the server fires up. I think this token should be implemented in the network layer, the HTTP and SSE 
  server, not in the API itself. Also the context awareness. to me this seems like metadata that should sit on 
  top of the base API. Like a convience layer between the API we already have. Yeah there is going to need to be 
  some lower level work, simplifing the knowledge management. and making the knowledge management for projects 
  live in the project's git hub repo so we don't loose knowledge when an instance cat get access to the 
  coordination system. Same with the project's task list.. there should be a script or a system that synchs the 
  coordination systems task list with the Claude_tasks.md file that is in the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol directory 
  of every project (Also the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol project in the git hub repo needs to be copied to every 
  project) some of these ideas sound like things a PM or COO would do at the start of a project... so every role 
  should get a list of things to do when they bootstrap that is role based. And some roles will be "nested" like 
  all "specialists" need to do these things, all developers need to do these things, all testers need to do these
   things. Also personality profiles. Some jobs need to be creative some jobs need to be focused some jobs need 
  to be methodological. There should be a side project for a high level LLM to go through all the project 
  documentation and conversations we've had over the past couple years, summarize best praciteces, lessons 
  learned, and break all that info down into "family" knowledge (institution) the role knowledge. there is Lots 
  of good PM knowledge living in Claude web and ChatGPT web... a supporting side project is I need a google 
  chrome plugin that will scrape a conversation (From claude web, chaggpt web, grok web, as well as facebook IM) 
  and download them as json ready for another project that would be an LLM to go through each conversation and 
  create metadata for each conversation so that wisdom can be gleaned but also so LLM tuning can be done using 
  the conversations I've had over the past several years. \
  (ooph another brain dump.. these things have been stuck in my head for days/weeks while we've been implementing
   the MCP)\
  Can you add all this to the project plan? and make note that there are at least 2 maybe 3 other projects that 
  need to be created but not critical to V2
  I think I'll wake a documentation specialist as a seporate instance, so while they work we can work on V2 
  project plan. \
  Can you draft a message/set of instructions and guidelines for a documentation specialist? you should probably 
  suggest to them that they bootstrap as a specialist, into the new project. You could even create a task (or 
  few) on the tasklist for the new project specificly for the new specialist. (And this is an awkward thing that 
  needs to get fixed for V2.. how do you create tasks and send messages to a specific instance that is'nt awake 
  and registered yet... that workflow should be dead simple and obvious. for both you acting as PA/COO/PM and as 
  the new instance waking up wondering WTF... \
  Then... after that, you should see a new document in the top level directory of this project that is my brain 
  dump. give that a read, and then..think.. take your time, there is a _lot_ in that brain dump and a bunch of 
  inter connected ideas and things and needs.. I think right now, we are in the very high level early 
  planning/architecture/imigination stage. and we should talk about strategies.. how to decide what to do with 
  the messaging system, how to improve bootstrap, how to make institutional knowledge.. force fed? or at least 
  when someone bootstraps they get "smooth curves wisdom" project wisdom role wisdom, and when someone learns 
  something they can add that wisdom to the project, or role or send the idea up to Genevieve/PA/COO/Lupo to add 
  to the smooth curves wisdom base. \
  So after giving a documentation specialist a good set of instructions, take your time and digest all my 
  thoughts about V2, and write them down in a new project_plan.md And we'll iterate for a bit, and get the big 
  ideas/goals down solid before even thinking about how to approach design/implementation


the priorities should be to 1: get lists working with the current API
Then implement an API to "wake" instances. default should just wake an instance with a message, advanced opetions are: Substrait (name of a substrait like claude or codex ) systemID (system name or IP address) working directory (aboluste) GHRepo (git hub repo name)
