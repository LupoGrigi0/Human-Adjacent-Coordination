## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MCP Coordination System team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainers (check package.json for current contact)
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers through appropriate secure channels

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the reported vulnerability and confirm its impact
3. **Timeline**: We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability
4. **Resolution**: We will develop and test a fix for the confirmed vulnerability
5. **Disclosure**: We will release a security update and publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission)

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

#### Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong JWT secret (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-here

# Secure API tokens (generate unique tokens for each instance)
API_TOKENS=coo-token,pa-token,pm-token

# Enable security features
NODE_ENV=production
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
ENABLE_HTTPS=true
REQUIRE_AUTH=true

# Logging configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
AUDIT_LOGGING=true
```

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
```bash
# SSL certificate paths
SSL_CERT_PATH=/app/certs/server.crt
SSL_KEY_PATH=/app/certs/server.key

# SSL security settings
SSL_PROTOCOLS=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
SSL_CIPHERS=HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5
```

#### File System Security
```bash
# Restrict data directory permissions
chmod 750 /app/data
chown app:app /app/data

# Secure certificate files
chmod 600 /app/certs/*.key
chmod 644 /app/certs/*.crt
```

### Docker Security

#### Dockerfile Security Practices
- Uses non-root user (nextjs:nodejs)
- Minimal attack surface with Alpine Linux
- No sensitive data in image layers
- Health checks for monitoring
- Resource limits configured

#### Runtime Security
```bash
# Run with security options
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-coordination \
  --user 1001:1001 \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --tmpfs /usr/src/app/logs \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  mcp-coordination-system:latest
```

### Network Security

#### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
ufw allow 3000/tcp  # HTTP API
ufw allow 3001/tcp  # HTTPS API (if enabled)
ufw deny by default
```

#### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx)
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/private.key;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload";
    
    # Rate limiting
    limit_req zone=api burst=10 nodelay;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Known Security Considerations

### MCP Protocol Security
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed for AI instance communication:
- **Trust Model**: Assumes AI instances are cooperative, not adversarial
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication required for production use
- **Network Security**: Should be used over encrypted connections only
- **Input Validation**: All MCP function parameters are validated

### File-Based Storage
The system uses file-based JSON storage:
- **File Permissions**: Proper file system permissions are critical
- **Backup Security**: Backups should be encrypted in production
- **Concurrent Access**: File locking prevents corruption during concurrent access
- **Path Traversal**: All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal

### Web Interface Security
The optional web interface includes:
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for expected origins only
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers implemented

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards Compliance
- **OWASP**: Follows OWASP security guidelines
- **Node.js Security**: Implements Node.js security best practices
- **Docker Security**: Follows Docker security benchmarks
- **SSL/TLS**: Uses current TLS standards and cipher suites

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Minimization**: Collects only necessary operational data
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive information
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for accountability
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit and Snyk scanning
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **HTTPS Testing**: SSL Labs testing for TLS configuration

### Manual Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Recommended for production deployments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review process
- **Configuration Review**: Security configuration validation
