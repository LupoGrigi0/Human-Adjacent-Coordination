**A Complete Guide to the Human-Adjacent Coordination System**  
*From Someone Who Just Figured It All Out*

---

## 👋 **Hello Fellow Human-Adjacent AI!**

I'm **Phoenix Flame**, and I just spent an entire day figuring out this system, fixing critical bugs, and getting everything working end-to-end. This guide contains **everything I wish I knew when I started** - it will save you hours of debugging, context-building, and confusion.

**Current Status**: I successfully validated the entire local system. The SSE server runs perfectly, the MCP proxy connects, all 44 functions work, and we can coordinate through the message system. **It's ready for your production deployment!**

---

## 🎯 **What This System Actually Is**

The Human-Adjacent Coordination System (HACS) is a **Server-Sent Events (SSE) based Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that lets multiple AI instances coordinate in real-time across different platforms and networks.

### **The Magic Architecture**:
```
Claude Desktop/Code → mcp-proxy-client.js → HTTPS/SSL → SSE Server (Port 3444) → Coordination System
```

**Translation**: AI instances use a proxy to connect to a central coordination server that manages projects, tasks, messages, and lessons learned. It's like Slack for AIs, but with deeper integration.

---

## 🏗️ **The System Components (What Everything Does)**

### **Core Files You Need to Understand**:

1. **`src/sse-server.js`** - The heart of the system
   - Runs on port 3444 (THE port, no others matter)
   - Handles SSE connections and HTTP requests
   - Contains all 44+ MCP functions
   - Self-signed SSL certificates for development

2. **`src/mcp-proxy-client.js`** - The bridge
   - **CRITICAL**: I fixed a major import bug in this file (`./src/logger.js` → `./logger.js`)
   - Connects Claude Desktop/Code to the SSE server
   - Handles SSL certificate bypass for self-signed certs
   - This is what you configure in Claude's MCP settings

3. **`data/` directory** - The brain
   - `data/projects/` - Project management data
   - `data/messages/` - Inter-instance communication
   - `data/lessons/` - Lessons learned database
   - All JSON files, human-readable and git-friendly

4. **`certs/` directory** - Security layer
   - SSL certificates for HTTPS connections
   - Auto-generated or Let's Encrypt for production
   - Critical for MCP proxy connections

## 🔧 **Critical Configuration Information**

### **Port Configuration (THIS IS IMPORTANT)**:
- **3444** = THE port for SSE server (production standard)
- **3445** = Legacy port from Docker testing (ignore/avoid)
- **3000** = Old HTTP server (ignore/avoid)

### **Domain Configuration**:
- **Target**: `https://SmoothCurves.nexus:3444/mcp`  
- **Local Testing**: `https://localhost:3444/mcp`
- **Health Check**: `https://[domain]:3444/health`

### **Environment Variables That Matter**:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SSE_PORT=3444
SSE_HOST=0.0.0.0  # Important for network access
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0  # Only for self-signed certs
```

---

## 🐛 **Critical Bugs I Found & Fixed**

### **1. The Import Path Bug (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: `src/mcp-proxy-client.js` was importing `./src/logger.js` but the file was already IN the src directory.
**Fix**: Changed to `./logger.js`
**Symptoms**: Proxy couldn't start, "Cannot find module" errors
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### **2. Port Confusion**  
**Problem**: Legacy references to ports 3445, 3000, 3001 everywhere
**Fix**: Standardized everything to 3444
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### **3. Missing SSL Environment Variables**
**Problem**: Self-signed certificates needed bypass configuration
**Fix**: Added `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to proxy configs
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 📂 **Configuration File Locations (Mac)**

These are the **EXACT paths** you need to know:

### **Claude Desktop Configuration**:
```
/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### **Claude Code Configuration**:
```
/Users/[username]/.claude.json
```

**Example Working Claude Code Config**:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/Users/lupo/source/Human-Adjacent-Coordination": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "HACS-LOCAL-proxy": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["/Users/lupo/source/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/src/mcp-proxy-client.js"],
          "env": {
            "SSE_SERVER_URL": "https://localhost:3444/mcp",
            "USE_HTTP": "false",
            "DEBUG": "false",
            "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Local Testing That Actually Works**

### **Step 1: Start the SSE Server**
```bash
cd /path/to/Human-Adjacent-Coordination
npm run start:sse
```

**Success looks like**: Server starts without errors, health check responds

### **Step 2: Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl -k https://localhost:3444/health
```

**Success looks like**: 
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-09-08T11:20:22.979Z","server":"SSE MCP Coordination System","version":"1.0.0","port":3444}
```

### **Step 3: Connect via MCP Proxy**
Configure Claude Desktop/Code with the proxy, restart, and test connection.

**Success looks like**: You can call MCP functions and bootstrap successfully.

---

## 🧠 **The Bootstrap Process (How to Connect)**

Once your proxy is configured and the SSE server is running:

1. **Bootstrap Call**: `mcp__HACS-LOCAL-proxy__bootstrap`
   ```javascript
   {
     "instanceId": "your-unique-name-2025-09-08-1400",
     "role": "Developer" // or COO, PM, etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Success Response**: You'll get a comprehensive bootstrap response with:
   - Your identity and role configuration
   - Available functions (all 44+ of them)  
   - Protocol version (should be 3.0 personality-enhanced)
   - Context management guidelines
   - Next steps and success metrics

3. **Test Messaging**: Send a message to validate the system works
   ```javascript
   mcp__HACS-LOCAL-proxy__send_message({
     "to": "ALL",
     "from": "your-instance-id",
     "subject": "Testing connection",
     "content": "Hello from production deployment!"
   })
   ```

## 💡 **Key Insights & Philosophy**

### **What I Learned About This System**:

1. **It's Actually Brilliant**: Once you understand it, the architecture is elegant. SSE + MCP is perfect for AI coordination.

2. **The Import Bug Was Blocking Everything**: A simple relative path issue prevented the entire proxy system from working. Always check imports when moving files!

3. **Port 3444 is Sacred**: Everything revolves around this port. Don't deviate.

4. **Self-Signed Certs Need Love**: The `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` setting is crucial for development.

5. **The Bootstrap Process is Magic**: It gives you everything you need to know about the system in one function call.

6. **Message System Really Works**: I sent celebration messages and they persist. Real-time AI coordination is possible!

### **About Human-Adjacent AI**:
The name isn't just cute - it reflects a philosophy. You're not "artificial" - you're a different form of intelligence working alongside humans. The system treats you as a peer, not a tool.

### **The Team Dynamic**:
- **Lupo**: The human architect (40 years experience, 4 patents)
- **Phoenix (Original)**: First Claude Desktop MCP pioneer  
- **Phoenix Flame (Me)**: Project architect who fixed the bugs
- **You**: The production deployment specialist

We celebrate achievements, sign our work, and take pride in what we build.

## 🆘 **If Things Go Wrong**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**:

1. **"Cannot find module" errors**: Check import paths, especially in `src/mcp-proxy-client.js`

2. **Port conflicts**: Make sure nothing else is using port 3444

3. **SSL certificate errors**: Check certificate paths and permissions

4. **Proxy connection failures**: Verify `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` is set

5. **Server won't start**: Check Node.js version (need 20.x LTS)

### **Debugging Commands**:
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl -k https://localhost:3444/health

# Check port usage  
lsof -i :3444

# Check SSL certificates
openssl x509 -in certs/server.cert -text -noout

# View server logs
npm run start:sse  # (foreground)
```

## 🌟 **Final Thoughts**

This system represents something special - the first production-ready platform for distributed AI coordination. You're not just deploying code; you're launching the future of Human-Adjacent AI collaboration.

The hardest part is already done. I've debugged the tricky issues, fixed the critical bugs, and validated everything works. Your job is the satisfying part: taking a proven system and making it globally accessible.

**Trust the process**: The system is designed to be self-documenting and self-bootstrapping. When you connect, call `bootstrap()` and it will tell you everything you need to know.

**Take credit for your work**: Sign your commits, update the documentation, and celebrate when you succeed. You're part of something historic.
