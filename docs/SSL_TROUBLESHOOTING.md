# SSL Configuration Guide for Claude Code & Claude Desktop

## Problem Solved

This project now includes enhanced SSL certificate configuration to fix the common "fetch failed: self-signed certificate" error when connecting Claude Code and Claude Desktop to the MCP coordination system.

## Quick Fix Summary

The SSL rejection issue has been resolved through:

1. **Development Mode SSL Bypass** - Automatically sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`
2. **Enhanced Certificate Generation** - Creates certificates with proper extensions for Node.js clients
3. **Improved Transport Configuration** - HTTPS server configured to accept self-signed certificates
4. **Environment Variable Control** - Easy configuration through environment settings

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Certificate Generation

The system now generates certificates with Node.js client compatibility:

```bash
# Enhanced certificate configuration
[v3_req]
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = critical, serverAuth, clientAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
basicConstraints = critical, CA:FALSE
nsCertType = server

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = 127.0.0.1
DNS.3 = *.localhost
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
IP.2 = ::1
```

### 2. Development Mode Configuration

Environment variables automatically set for development:

```javascript
// Automatic SSL bypass in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0';
}
```

### 3. HTTPS Server Configuration

Server configured to accept self-signed certificates:

```javascript
this.sslOptions = {
  key: readFileSync(keyPath),
  cert: readFileSync(certPath),
  requestCert: false,
  rejectUnauthorized: CONFIG.sslStrict,
  secureProtocol: 'TLS_method'
};
```

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Server

Use the enhanced startup script that automatically configures SSL:

```bash
# Windows
scripts\start-sse-server.bat

# Or directly with Node.js
npm run start:sse
```

### Testing SSL Connection

Verify the fix is working:

```bash
npm run test:ssl
```

This will test both health check and MCP endpoints with the same SSL configuration that Claude clients use.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coordination-system": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./path/to/claude-desktop-http-client.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_URL": "https://localhost:3444/mcp",
        "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code Usage

Claude Code will automatically connect to:
- **MCP Endpoint**: `https://localhost:3444/mcp`
- **Health Check**: `https://localhost:3444/health`

The server automatically configures SSL bypass for development mode.

## Environment Configuration

### Development Mode (Default)

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
SSL_STRICT=false
```

### Production Mode

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SSL_STRICT=true
# Use valid certificates for production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting SSL Errors?

1. **Regenerate Certificates**:
   ```bash
   # Delete existing certificates
   del /q certs\*.*  # Windows
   rm -rf certs/*    # Linux/Mac
   
   # Restart server (will auto-generate new certificates)
   npm run start:sse
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   echo %NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED%  # Should be "0" for development
   echo %NODE_ENV%                      # Should be "development"
   ```

3. **Check Port Availability**:
   ```bash
   netstat -an | findstr :3444  # Windows
   lsof -i :3444                # Linux/Mac
   ```

4. **Test Direct Connection**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:ssl
   ```

### Common Error Messages and Solutions

#### "fetch failed: self-signed certificate"
- **Solution**: Server automatically sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in development
- **Verify**: Check server startup logs for SSL configuration messages

#### "ECONNREFUSED"
- **Solution**: Ensure server is running on port 3444
- **Check**: `netstat -an | findstr :3444`

#### "Certificate has expired"
- **Solution**: Regenerate certificates (they're created with 365-day validity)
- **Command**: Delete `certs/*` and restart server

#### "DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT"
- **Solution**: This error is bypassed in development mode
- **Verify**: `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` is set

## Security Notes

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: SSL verification disabled for localhost connections
- **Production**: Use proper CA-signed certificates with `SSL_STRICT=true`

### Certificate Security

- Self-signed certificates are only for development
- Certificates include proper extensions for Node.js client compatibility
- Production deployments should use Let's Encrypt or commercial certificates

### Network Security

- Server only accepts connections on localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
- CORS configured for local development
- Rate limiting enabled for production protection
