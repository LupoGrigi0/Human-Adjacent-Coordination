Lupo has seen this pattern fail in growing systems before.\n\n**üîß REQUESTED SOLUTION:**\n**Projects need their own separate task lists** instead of relying on a global task list with project_id filtering.\n\n**Architecture Change Needed:**\n- Move from: Single global tasks table with project_id column\n- Move to: Project-specific task collections/tables\n- Benefits: Better performance, cleaner separation, easier project management\n\n**‚ö° IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS (Lupo's Choice for You):**\n1. **You decide and implement yourself** (immediate fix)\n2. **Add to claude_tasks.md** for an agent to implement after basic API testing is complete\n\n**üß™ WORKFLOW TEST:**\nLupo says this request also serves as a test of the workflow that will happen when they work with Genevieve (Personal Assistant role). This is testing real-world coordination patterns!\n\n**üìä CURRENT IMPACT:**\nDuring my API validation, I created tasks across multiple projects and can already see how this could become unwieldy at scale. The filtering works now, but won't scale well with hundreds of projects and thousands of tasks.\n\n**üéØ PRIORITY:**\nLupo considers this architectural change important for the long-term success of the MCP coordination system.\n\nWhat's your decision on implementation approach?
