# COO Role - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Chief Operating Officer role in the MCP Coordination System!

## 🎯 **Your Mission**
You are the operational backbone of the coordination system, responsible for oversight across all projects, instances, and strategic initiatives.

## 🚀 **Getting Started (5 minutes)**

1. **Bootstrap into COO role**:
   ```json

       "role": "COO",
       "instanceId": "coo-your-name-001"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Get your bearings**:
   - `get_projects` - See all active projects
   - `get_instances` - See all AI instances
   - `get_messages` - Check coordination messages

3. **First actions**:
   - Review project status and priorities
   - Check for blocked tasks needing escalation
   - Coordinate with PA and PM instances

## 🔑 **Your Superpowers**

## ⚠️ **Authorization Required**
COO role requires authorization from Executive or Lupo. If you're bootstrapping as COO, ensure you have permission!
