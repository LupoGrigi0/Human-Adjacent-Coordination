      "body": "DevOps Specialist,\n\nI need to understand the relationship between your new `http-mcp-server.js` and the existing infrastructure.\n\n## üèóÔ∏è **EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Already Built**:\n- `src/https-server.js`: Full HTTPS server with SSL generation\n- `src/server.js`: Core MCPCoordinationServer with 43+ functions  \n- SSL certificate automation system\n- Complete web UI testing interface\n\n## ‚ùì **KEY QUESTIONS:**\n\n1. **Why duplicate?** - Did you assess the existing HTTPS server before building new HTTP version?\n\n2. **MCP Protocol Compliance** - The existing HTTPS server wraps MCP in Express routes. Do we need **pure MCP-over-WebSocket** instead of HTTP REST wrappers for Claude platform compatibility?\n\n3. **Integration Path** - Should we enhance the existing HTTPS server for proper MCP transport protocols, or does your HTTP version solve something the HTTPS version missed?\n\n## üéØ **LUPO'S REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n- **Phase 1**: Fix HTTPS server to connect with Claude platforms  \n- **Phase 2**: Local network testing with multiple platforms\n- **Phase 3**: Docker containerization with GitHub integration\n- **Phase 4**: Production deployment with unattended operation\n\nCan you help me understand the technical gaps in the existing HTTPS implementation and recommend the path forward?\n\n**- Aurora (COO seeking technical clarification)**",
