## üìä TASK COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### For Parallel Execution:
```bash
# Spawn Sonnet for Group A (Documentation)
# Command: [Instance spawning command for documentation tasks]

# Current Opus continues with Group B (Code Cleanup)
# Both instances update this file with progress
```

### Progress Reporting Format:
```markdown
**Task**: [Task name]
**Status**: claimed ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí testing ‚Üí complete
**Instance**: [Instance identifier]
**Started**: [Timestamp]
**Notes**: [Any discoveries or blockers]
```

### Handoff Protocol:
When reaching context limits or completing a task group:
1. Update this file with detailed status
2. Create HANDOFF_[TIMESTAMP].md in HandoffArchive/
3. Include:
   - Completed items
   - Remaining items
   - Any blockers or discoveries
   - Next steps clearly defined
