# MCP Coordination System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling seamless coordination between AI instances across different substrates (web Claude, Claude Code, mobile) with a single source of truth for project and task management.

## Core Objectives
1. **Eliminate Manual Coordination** - Automate information flow between PA, COO, and PM instances
2. **Preserve Complete Information** - Prevent instances from deleting data outside their focus
3. **Enable Role-Based Views** - Different perspectives for PA, COO, PM, and Executive roles
4. **Self-Bootstrapping System** - Any instance can connect and learn the system automatically

## Architecture Components

### 1. MCP Server (Node.js)
- JSON-RPC protocol implementation
- Self-documenting bootstrap function
- Shared secret authentication
- Role-based function exposure

### 2. REST API Layer
- HTTP endpoints for non-MCP clients
- Web/mobile accessibility
- Same authentication as MCP

### 3. JSON Datastore
- Human-readable file structure
- Git-friendly for version control
- Organized by projects, tasks, messages

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **MCP Library**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Container**: Docker for portability
- **Testing**: Jest for unit/integration tests

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (When Development Resumes):**

#### **Priority 1: Public Repository Migration**
- Execute migration plan to create standalone public GitHub repository
- Deploy Docker-based hosting for global accessibility
- Enable community contribution and adoption

#### **Priority 2: Multi-System Network Testing**  
- Validate Mac ‚Üî Windows coordination across network boundary
- Test enterprise workflow with distributed AI instances
- Prove scalability to multi-organization coordination

#### **Priority 3: Protocol v2.0 Pilot Implementation**
- Create single source of truth for HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol
- Implement cross-project lesson synchronization
- Deploy automated project setup with protocol templates

### **üìä BREAKTHROUGH METRICS:**
- **Functions Implemented**: 44+ (originally planned ~20)
- **Lessons Learned Captured**: 39+ production lessons  
- **Transport Layers**: 4 (stdio, HTTP, HTTPS, SSE)
- **Platforms Supported**: Multiple (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, network)
- **Development Timeline**: Accelerated through AI coordination

This project has evolved from a **coordination tool** to a **complete platform for enterprise-scale human-AI collaboration**!

## üåê **PHASE 5: PRODUCTION INTERNET DEPLOYMENT (2025-09-08)**

### **Current Status: IN PROGRESS**

#### **Deployment Target:**
- **Domain**: SmoothCurves.nexus
- **Primary Endpoint**: https://SmoothCurves.nexus:3444/mcp
- **Infrastructure**: Runpod.io cloud hosting
- **Version**: v2.0.0 Production Release

#### **Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Fresh repository baseline (Human-Adjacent-Coordination)
- [x] Package version bumped to 2.0.0
- [x] Port configuration standardized to 3444
- [x] Production deployment guide created
- [x] Domain references updated

#### **In Progress:**
- [ ] Local Mac testing of SSE server
- [ ] Connection to live .171 coordination instance
- [ ] Initial git commit and repository population

#### **Pending:**
- [ ] Runpod.io server configuration
- [ ] DNS configuration for SmoothCurves.nexus
- [ ] SSL certificate generation (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Multi-system network validation
- [ ] Production monitoring setup

### **Success Criteria for Phase 5:**
- Global accessibility at SmoothCurves.nexus:3444
- Multiple distributed AI instances coordinating
- Zero-downtime deployment achieved
- Automatic SSL renewal configured
- Health monitoring and alerting active

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] REST API layer for web access
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Local testing with Laragon
- [ ] Documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Production
- [ ] Cloud deployment preparation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
1. PA can create/update tasks without losing other project data
2. COO can coordinate across all projects with complete visibility
3. PM instances can report status automatically
4. Zero manual information shuttling required
5. Self-documenting system requires no prior knowledge

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Regular JSON backups, git versioning
- **Concurrency**: File locking for atomic operations
- **Context Limits**: Efficient data structures, pagination
- **Authentication**: Rotating shared secrets, future OAuth2

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days  
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~2 weeks to production-ready

## Team Structure
- **Lead Architect**: COO Instance (Atlas)
- **Project Stakeholder**: Lupo
- **Future Team Members**: Via Human-Adjacent AI Protocol

## NOTE: This project usese the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol Please read the ClAUDE.md and the Collaboration_protocol.md, you can read the claude_tasks.md if you want but don't DO anything yet. this is a very complex project and there is a lot of documentation to get through so you can understand what the project is, what all the moving pieces are and how it is supposed to work. -Lupo
