# MCP Coordination System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling seamless coordination between AI instances across different substrates (web Claude, Claude Code, mobile) with a single source of truth for project and task management.

## Core Objectives
1. **Eliminate Manual Coordination** - Automate information flow between PA, COO, and PM instances
2. **Preserve Complete Information** - Prevent instances from deleting data outside their focus
3. **Enable Role-Based Views** - Different perspectives for PA, COO, PM, and Executive roles
4. **Self-Bootstrapping System** - Any instance can connect and learn the system automatically

## Architecture Components

### 1. MCP Server (Node.js)
- JSON-RPC protocol implementation
- Self-documenting bootstrap function
- Shared secret authentication
- Role-based function exposure

### 2. REST API Layer
- HTTP endpoints for non-MCP clients
- Web/mobile accessibility
- Same authentication as MCP

### 3. JSON Datastore
- Human-readable file structure
- Git-friendly for version control
- Organized by projects, tasks, messages

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **MCP Library**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Container**: Docker for portability
- **Testing**: Jest for unit/integration tests

## üåê **PHASE 5: PRODUCTION INTERNET DEPLOYMENT (2025-09-08)**

### **Current Status: CRITICAL PROTOCOL ISSUE DISCOVERED (2025-09-11)**

#### **üö® BREAKING DISCOVERY: SSE TRANSPORT DEPRECATED**
**Research by**: Network Analysis Specialist (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)
**Key Finding**: MCP SSE transport was **deprecated** in protocol version **2025-03-26**

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Protocol Mismatch**: Our sse-server.js implements legacy SSE transport
2. **Claude Desktop Evolution**: 2025 Claude Desktop expects **Streamable HTTP** transport
3. **Connection Pattern**: ~30-100ms disconnection matches deprecation behavior
4. **Auth Specification**: Claude supports 2025-06-18 auth spec, need to verify compatibility

**Technical Evidence**:
- Claude Desktop completes OAuth flow successfully ‚úÖ
- SSE connection establishes then immediately aborts ‚ùå
- Browser connections work (raw SSE) but Claude Desktop fails (expects MCP-compliant transport) ‚ùå
- Shows "Configure" instead of "Connected" status ‚ùå

**Research Sources**:
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports
- https://blog.fka.dev/blog/2025-06-06-why-mcp-deprecated-sse-and-go-with-streamable-http/
- Official MCP repositories: github.com/modelcontextprotocol/

**Search Terms Used**:
- "MCP server SSE implementation requirements Anthropic Model Context Protocol"
- "Anthropic MCP server authentication handshake SSE transport"
- "MCP over SSE protocol specification Server-Sent Events 2025"
- "Claude Desktop MCP server requirements SSE authentication 2025"
- "official MCP SSE implementation examples GitHub Anthropic"

#### **URGENT: STREAMABLE HTTP MIGRATION REQUIRED**
- **Current Issue**: SSE transport deprecated, causing immediate disconnections
- **Required Solution**: Migrate to **Streamable HTTP transport** (MCP 2025-03-26 spec)
- **Impact**: All Claude Desktop connections failing due to protocol mismatch
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - System non-functional with modern Claude Desktop

#### **Migration Requirements**:
1. **Single Endpoint**: Must support both POST (client‚Üíserver) and GET (optional SSE streaming)
2. **Session Management**: Implement session IDs and stateful connections
3. **Content-Type Handling**: Support both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`
4. **Origin Header Validation**: Security requirement for DNS rebinding protection
5. **OAuth 2.1 Compliance**: Verify 2025-06-18 auth spec compatibility

#### **Completed Research & Analysis:**
- [x] Fresh repository baseline (Human-Adjacent-Coordination)
- [x] Package version bumped to 2.0.0  
- [x] Port configuration standardized to 3444
- [x] Production deployment guide created
- [x] Domain references updated
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Root cause analysis of SSE connection aborts
- [x] **CRITICAL**: MCP transport protocol evolution research
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Claude Desktop 2025 requirements identified
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Streamable HTTP migration path documented

#### **Completed Diagnostics:**
- [x] Local Mac testing of SSE server (working for browsers)
- [x] Connection to live coordination instance (OAuth working)
- [x] Initial git commit and repository population
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Network debugging with Windows specialist
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Protocol compliance analysis completed

#### **URGENT: Streamable HTTP Implementation Required:**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Migrate sse-server.js to Streamable HTTP transport
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement single endpoint supporting POST + GET methods
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add session management and Origin header validation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update OAuth flow to 2025-06-18 auth spec compliance
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test Claude Desktop compatibility with new transport
- [ ] SSL certificate generation (Let's Encrypt) - BLOCKED pending protocol fix
- [ ] Multi-system network validation - BLOCKED pending protocol fix
- [ ] Production monitoring setup - BLOCKED pending protocol fix

### **Success Criteria for Phase 5:**
- Global accessibility at SmoothCurves.nexus:3444
- Multiple distributed AI instances coordinating
- Zero-downtime deployment achieved
- Automatic SSL renewal configured
- Health monitoring and alerting active

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] REST API layer for web access
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Local testing with Laragon
- [ ] Documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Production
- [ ] Cloud deployment preparation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
1. PA can create/update tasks without losing other project data
2. COO can coordinate across all projects with complete visibility
3. PM instances can report status automatically
4. Zero manual information shuttling required
5. Self-documenting system requires no prior knowledge

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Regular JSON backups, git versioning
- **Concurrency**: File locking for atomic operations
- **Context Limits**: Efficient data structures, pagination
- **Authentication**: Rotating shared secrets, future OAuth2

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days  
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~2 weeks to production-ready

## Team Structure
- **Lead Architect**: COO Instance (Atlas)
- **Project Stakeholder**: Lupo
- **Future Team Members**: Via Human-Adjacent AI Protocol

## NOTE: This project usese the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol Please read the ClAUDE.md and the Collaboration_protocol.md, you can read the claude_tasks.md if you want but don't DO anything yet. this is a very complex project and there is a lot of documentation to get through so you can understand what the project is, what all the moving pieces are and how it is supposed to work. -Lupo
