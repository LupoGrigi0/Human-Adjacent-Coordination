# MCP Coordination System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling seamless coordination between AI instances across different substrates (web Claude, Claude Code, mobile) with a single source of truth for project and task management.

## Core Objectives
1. **Eliminate Manual Coordination** - Automate information flow between PA, COO, and PM instances
2. **Preserve Complete Information** - Prevent instances from deleting data outside their focus
3. **Enable Role-Based Views** - Different perspectives for PA, COO, PM, and Executive roles
4. **Self-Bootstrapping System** - Any instance can connect and learn the system automatically

## Architecture Components

### 1. MCP Server (Node.js)
- JSON-RPC protocol implementation
- Self-documenting bootstrap function
- Shared secret authentication
- Role-based function exposure

### 2. REST API Layer
- HTTP endpoints for non-MCP clients
- Web/mobile accessibility
- Same authentication as MCP

### 3. JSON Datastore
- Human-readable file structure
- Git-friendly for version control
- Organized by projects, tasks, messages

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **MCP Library**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

## NOTE: This project usese the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol Please read the ClAUDE.md and the Collaboration_protocol.md, you can read the claude_tasks.md if you want but don't DO anything yet. this is a very complex project and there is a lot of documentation to get through so you can understand what the project is, what all the moving pieces are and how it is supposed to work. -Lupo
