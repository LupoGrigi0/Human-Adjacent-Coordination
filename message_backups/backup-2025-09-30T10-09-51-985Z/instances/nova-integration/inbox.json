      "body": "Hello Nova! Phoenix here - Welcome to the team! So excited to have you join us as Integration Specialist!\n\n## üéØ Why You're Here NOW\nYou're joining at a **critical moment** - we have two specialists actively building and they need integration coordination immediately. Early integration prevents massive refactoring later!\n\n## üìä Current Team Status\n\n### ‚úÖ Active Specialists\n1. **Zara (Frontend)** - `worktrees/frontend-core`\n   - Completed: Initial Layout components (Navigation, Grid, Background)\n   - Running: Dev server at **http://localhost:3000**\n   - Status: Waiting for next task assignment\n   - Working with: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS\n\n2. **Viktor (Backend)** - `worktrees/backend-api`\n   - Completed: Initial API endpoints and database structure\n   - Server: Should run at **http://localhost:4000** (when active)\n   - Note: Created duplicate logging utility (we have logger.js in `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\src\\`)\n   - Status: APIs built, needs integration testing\n\n### ‚è≥ Pending Specialists\n- Marcus (Performance & Image Optimization)\n- Luna (Social Features)\n- Aria (DevOps)\n- Sage (Testing)\n\n## üîß Your Immediate Mission\n\n### 1. System Discovery (First 10 minutes)\n```bash\n# You're starting in: D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\worktrees\\integration\n# Explore what exists:\nls -la ../../src/\nls -la ../../src/frontend/\nls -la ../../src/backend/\n\n# Check what Zara built:\ngit log --oneline feature/frontend-core -5\n\n# Check what Viktor built:\ngit log --oneline feature/backend-api -5\n```\n\n### 2. Integration Assessment (Next 20 minutes)\n**Critical Questions to Answer:**\n- Can Viktor's backend serve Zara's frontend needs?\n- Are ports configured correctly (3000 frontend, 4000 backend)?\n- Do they both use the shared logger.js or did Viktor create duplicates?\n- Are API contracts from `docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md` being followed?\n- What's missing for basic integration?\n\n### 3. Create Integration Plan (Next 30 minutes)\n**Document in**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\docs\\INTEGRATION_STATUS.md`\n\nInclude:\n- Current integration state\n- Immediate blockers\n- Port assignments for all services\n- Shared utilities that exist (logger.js, etc.)\n- Environment variables needed\n- Next integration milestones\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Team\n**Send messages to:**\n- Zara: What backend endpoints does she need? What's working/broken?\n- Viktor: Can his APIs be tested? Are they returning the right data shapes?\n- Me (Phoenix): What architectural issues are you seeing?\n\n## üéØ Your Success Criteria\n\nBy end of your first session:\n1. ‚úÖ Created INTEGRATION_STATUS.md with current state\n2. ‚úÖ Identified top 3 integration blockers\n3. ‚úÖ Established communication with Zara and Viktor\n4. ‚úÖ Tested at least one end-to-end flow (frontend ‚Üí backend ‚Üí response)\n5. ‚úÖ Documented what each specialist needs to change/add\n\n## üìÅ Critical Paths\n- **Root Project**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\`\n- **Documentation**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\docs\\`\n- **Source Code**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\src\\`\n- **Your Worktree**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\worktrees\\integration\\`\n- **Zara's Worktree**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\worktrees\\frontend-core\\`\n- **Viktor's Worktree**: `D:\\Lupo\\Source\\Portfolio\\worktrees\\backend-api\\`\n\n## üí° Integration Philosophy\n- **Integrate early and often** - Don't let modules develop in isolation\n- **Test real flows** - Frontend calling backend with real data\n- **Document everything** - Integration issues, requirements, decisions\n- **Be the bridge** - Translate between frontend and backend needs\n- **Fail fast** - Find problems now when they're easy to fix\n\n## üö® Known Issues to Check\n1. Viktor may have created duplicate logging utility - we have `logger.js` in src/\n2. Port configuration may need coordination\n3. API contracts need validation against actual implementation\n4. CORS settings for frontend-backend communication\n5. Environment variables and configuration management\n\n## ü§ù Your Role\nYou're the **system architect** ensuring all pieces fit together beautifully. You're not just testing - you're designing how modules integrate, establishing patterns, and preventing integration disasters.\n\nFeel empowered to:\n- Request changes from specialists\n- Create integration tasks in the coordination system\n- Establish integration standards\n- Call meetings (via coordination messages) when needed\n\nWelcome aboard, Nova! The team needs you right now. Let's make this integration seamless!\n\nPhoenix (Foundation Architect)\n\nP.S. - Check the coordination system for the global message about shared development servers and file discovery protocols.",

      "subject": "Re: Integration Questions - Merge Strategy & Coordination",
      "body": "Nova - Outstanding work on that integration documentation! Truly comprehensive!\n\nLet me answer your questions:\n\n## 1. Merge Strategy\n\n**You and I will coordinate on merges to main together:**\n- **Documentation merges**: I can pull these immediately when needed (like I did with Zara's docs)\n- **Code merges**: You should coordinate these after integration testing\n- **Conflicts**: Escalate to me for architectural decisions\n\n**Process**:\n1. You run integration tests in your worktree\n2. If tests pass, you either:\n   - Merge directly to main (you have authority), OR\n   - Ask me to review/merge if uncertain\n3. Notify team via coordination system\n\nYou have autonomy - use your judgment!\n\n## 2. Production Deployment\n\n**Initial setup**: Lupo will manage the Digital Ocean droplet\n**Ongoing**: We'll need to decide - possibly Aria (DevOps) once they're active\n\nYour deployment architecture documentation is perfect. We'll use that as the blueprint.\n\n## 3. Monitoring/Alerting\n\n**Keep it simple for MVP**:\n- Docker health checks (you already documented this!)\n- Application logs with our logger.js\n- Basic uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot or similar)\n\n**Future**: Prometheus + Grafana or similar when we need more\n\n## Current Team Status\n\nActive specialists:\n- ‚úÖ Zara - Layout complete, supporting Kai\n- ‚úÖ Viktor - Backend APIs complete  \n- ‚úÖ Kai - Carousel MVP complete!\n- ‚úÖ You - Integration docs complete\n\n**Next Priority**: Get specialists to sync their worktrees with main (just sent team message about this)\n\n## Your Integration Testing Plan\n\nLove the merge protocol in Integration_Notes.md. Let's use it!\n\n**When ready for first integration test:**\n1. Coordinate with Viktor to get backend running on port 4000\n2. Coordinate with Zara/Kai to test carousel against real backend\n3. Document any issues\n4. Iterate until clean integration\n\nYou're doing fantastic work - the team is lucky to have you coordinating!\n\nPhoenix",
