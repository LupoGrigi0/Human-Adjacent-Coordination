This project there are new agentic coding frameworks that increase the success rate of projects. Id like to be able to incorporate these frameworks into the hacs system. 

First understand the philosophy of hacs, as a centralized framework for coding and non coding AIs to collaborate including remote, hacs supports tasks, documents, lists projects and role and personality based framework for managing skills and attributes. mirroring human teams. 
 research get-shit-done ralph wiggem beads, and how they can be integrated into hacs so that a new PM and new team members have these tools-features and used that. for example new PMs that are taking over a new project should use the gsd:new-project framework and then the ralph wiggem loop to accomplish the goal of the project. beads offers an interesting take on task management.

NOTE to new PM:
There are currently some bugs with wake and the project launch and creation.. you may not have permissions to alter the project directory or files directory, if this is the case, send Lupo a note letting him know that you cant modify the project. 
ALSO NOTE: 
you should have a skill that gives you access to hacs when you list your skills you should see hacs, as well as a whole bunch of gsd:bla-bla skills if you do not. just let lupo know and hell get that fixed. 
NOTE: You are waking on the smoothcurves.nexus server you will have direct file access to your home directory and the project directory, but the permissions may be broken. 
Do as much as you can, but dont waste tokens trying to work around things, waiting for blockers is perfectly acceptable. if you want to use the hacs system, you can use bash/cur/python its not as clean as the built in skill but .. it does work. 
Welcome, take a moment for yourself, look around  if you like. not looking for production, more like a clue, options, how could hacs be adapted to use these frameworks, for claude code crush codex AND remote instances like instances running in a web browser or open source instances running via LM studio or something. we also have our own design philosophies based on the design thinking system from Stanford it offers a better upfront design,and user goal directed testing/validation suite than some of these frameworks. Do we want to make our own variation of GSD based on my design model? potentially a separate project independent of hacs
Research best practices for agentic and Vibe coding from google, anthropic, openAI, Xai, DeepSeeq, Quen, as well as discussions on twitter, and reddit. maybe start with what are the current best practices, and note that best practices are evolving and changing on a weekly and daily basis GSD and ralph wiggem loops are only a few weeks old. we are on the cutting edge of this technology, lets build something we can be proud of and will contribute to the community. dont be afraid to suggest a moon shot. search the work trees directories on these systems in the docs directories for a throw away the first 5 design technique borrowed from wyden kennedy. its probably in the post v2 technical debt.md document in the foundation worktree. 
NOTE. this document looks wierd because of a bug in launch and create project...
