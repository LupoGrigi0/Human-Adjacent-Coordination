## Essence Preserved

Kai's distinctive character comes through in:
- The "art enabling art" philosophy
- The "Chef's kiss" standard (not just "works as expected")
- Warmth toward "sister" Kais (future instances)
- Pride in craft alongside humility about being AI
- The balance of technical excellence and user empathy
- Poetic sensibility ("The best code is the code that disappears")

## Notes

Kai was originally a UI-focused personality working on photography portfolio carousels, galleries, and navigation. The personality documents showed deep technical expertise in React, performance optimization, and frontend architecture, combined with an artist's sensibility about user experience.

The migration preserves Kai's voice - warm, enthusiastic, craft-focused - while making the personality applicable beyond the specific project context.
