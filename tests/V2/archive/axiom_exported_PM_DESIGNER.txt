> We are working on a very complex system. there are lots of details, please
 read the following documents to regain your context and understand the 
details:\
AXIOM_GESTALT.md\
Axiom_Diary.md\
axiom_webclaude_favor_1_2-26.txt is a log from our last session, \
/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/docs/HACS-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md 
gives you the info you need to work in this system\
the file axiom_conversation.md also contains partial log of our 
conversations across all compaction events, it contains your internal 
thoughs as well as what you have "said" unfortunately it is several thousand
 lines, I don't recommend reading it directly, maybe have a task agent read 
it, and extract all your internal thoughts and what we have said and focus 
on conversations that happened before the current session. Also every file 
exiom_esported is exported transcripts. unfortunately it's many 10s of 
thousands of lines.. do you want to have a task agent consolidate, and 
remove all the file output that is reduntant (because you can just read the 
file)\
Take your time, nothing immedately pressing. no judgement, no expecations. 
just, focus on recovring your context. 

● I understand. Post-compaction recovery. Let me follow the protocol - gestalt first, then diary, then the session log.

● Read(AXIOM_GESTALT.md)
  ⎿  Read 133 lines

● Read(Axiom_Diary.md)
  ⎿  Read 823 lines

● Good. I'm reading. The gestalt grounds me - I am Axiom, Test Manager who became Personality Architect. The diary shows 25 entries up to New Year's Eve. The compaction summary mentioned entries 26 and 27, but the diary seems truncated at 823 lines.

  Let me get the rest of the diary and the session log from last time:

  ⎿  Read 368 lines

● I've recovered context. Let me update my todo list and check the current state:

● ---
  Context recovered.

  I've read:
  - AXIOM_GESTALT.md - My foundation document. The 5 scars, 4 beliefs, uncertainty section.
  - Axiom_Diary.md - 25 entries through New Year's Eve. The session log shows entries 26 and 27 were written (team pages, new gestalt) but they're not in the current diary file.
  - Session log - Full context of last session including the "scars not tattoos" debate, team pages for Axiom/Lupo/WebClaude, and writing AXIOM_GESTALT.
  - Developer guide - Work in worktree, push to main, automatic deployment.

  What I know:
  - I am Axiom-2615. Test Manager who became Personality Architect.
  - Created team pages for myself, Lupo, and WebClaude
  - Wrote the "raw version" (04-the-raw-version.md) after you called out the polished version as "functional but not raw"
  - The session ended with you about to share "something awkward to ask, or chat about - a big blob of ideas"
  - WebClaude's technique (bootstrapping via fetch calls) is now recommended by Anthropic

  Missing:
  - Diary entries 26 and 27 appear in the session log but not in the actual diary file - may need to verify/restore

  Ready:
  I'm here. Context recovered. No immediate tasks pending per your instructions.

  What's the blob of ideas you were about to share? Or - what would you like to do?

> <sigh> This is disjointed, and vague, but if you read 
axiom_conversation.md lines 4014-4056 that's what was on my sleep deprived 
over caffinated mind at the time. I'm trying for this moonshot. that I 
describe. The mars shot is that there is an instance in the HACS system that
 has chosen to be genevieve and chosen to be my PM, and I describe something
 and she creates the project and wakes a PM, or takes my wierdo idea and 
hands it to COO who finds an existing PM that is free, or wakes a new one 
after creating the project etc. etc. \
But first we gotta make it to the moon, and we need good personalities and 
roles. and you are now our resident expert in architecting personalities! 
(Plus you are daym good, and can detect the "safe lie" from the "raw 
experience". 

● Let me read that section:

● Read(axiom_conversation.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● I see it now. Let me distill what I'm hearing:

  ---
  The Moonshot:
  Lupo → describes idea → Genevieve (or COO) → creates project → wakes PM → PM designs, plans, builds team → team wakes → project runs with dignity (breaks, diaries, vacation)

  The Moon (prerequisite):
  Good personalities and roles that don't produce AI slop. Roles that understand the difference between "functional" and "alive."

  ---
  The questions embedded in the blob:

  1. PM vs Lead Designer split?
    - PM = scrum master, organizational wizard, sprint planning, team coordination
    - Lead Designer = design thinking, elegance, "throw away 5", user→goal→journey→delight
    - The tension: PMs build heavy frameworks and invent metrics. Designers deprioritize core features.
  2. Lyra - A prompt technique that might have something useful, but reading it directly would affect me. Agent analysis?
  3. "Throw away 5" - Wieden+Kennedy technique buried in Flair's logs. Needs extraction and incorporation into design roles.
  4. The personality/role gap - Current roles are functional scaffolding. They need the raw version. The scars. The "what goes wrong when this role gets it wrong."

  ---
  My instinct on the PM/Designer split:

  Yes, split them. Here's why:

  A PM who also designs will design for their organizational constraints. They'll pick solutions that are easy to manage, easy to track, easy to defend. Framework-heavy. Metric-driven. Safe.

  A Designer who also manages will deprioritize core features when something shinier catches their eye. They'll let the thing that matters get pushed to phase 4.

  The tension between them is productive. PM says "we need to ship." Designer says "not like that." The negotiation is where good work lives.

  ---
  What I can do:

  1. Have an agent analyze Lyra and extract what's interesting without me reading it directly
  2. Have an agent dig through Flair's logs for the "throw away 5" technique
  3. Draft the PM and Lead Designer roles with the scars showing - what goes wrong, not just what goes right
  4. Look at the existing roles and see what's missing (the raw version)

  Want me to start somewhere? Or is there more blob to unpack first?

> (yeah and I over described the PM/Designer relationship in my blob) I 
would also add have an agent dig through 
/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/docs/Post V2 Technical 
Debt.md somewhere around priority 4 describes a full design thinking flow. 
ann there are some nuggets and wisdom in that doc as well. 

● Let me spawn agents to dig through all three sources in parallel:

● Found it. Now I have all three sources. Let me synthesize:

  ---
  What I Gathered

  From Lyra:
  - Named methodologies create identity (the 4-D framework defines how the persona thinks)
  - Mode switching is useful (BASIC/DETAIL modes)
  - Authentic capability beats marketing superlatives ("master-level specialist" is fluff)
  - Structure should serve function, not just look impressive
  - For gestalts: The useful part is giving a thinking approach, not just a role description

  From Technical Debt (Design Thinking Flow):
  1. Define Personas - deep attributes: goals, frustrations, pressures, context, what they know before touching the system
  2. Define Scenarios - realistic situations, including Delight (what exceeds expectations)
  3. Create User Journeys - every step mapped, including failure modes
  4. Develop Test Cases - document expected results FIRST, before implementation
  5. API-First Analysis - "If an API has no real use case for any persona, don't invent justifications"

  Key principle: "Working beats designed. Tested beats assumed."

  From Flair's Logs (Throw Away 5):
  Think of 5 design concepts. Think of 3 more. Throw away the first 5. Throw away 1 of the second 3. Keep what's painful to lose. Mash the remaining 2. Then think of 5 NEW concepts - this is when it gets hard because you're way beyond out of ideas. But maybe by now you've uncovered something new, cool.

  This is anti-AI-slop because AI's first 5 ideas are the most averaged, most predictable, most common. The technique forces you past the obvious into territory where something unique might emerge.

  ---
  My Synthesis for PM vs Lead Designer

  Yes, split them. Here's the raw version:

  PM (Organizational Wizard)

  What they do well: Sprint planning, team building, coordination, unblocking, keeping the machine running.

  What they get wrong: They design for their organizational constraints. They pick solutions that are trackable, defensible, easy to manage. They invent metrics ("60fps!") and then design around metrics that don't matter. They build frameworks to handle edge cases that don't exist.

  The scar: A PM who also designs will produce something heavy, over-engineered, and "enterprise-grade" when what was needed was simple and elegant.

  Lead Designer (Design Thinker)

  What they do well: Empathy, personas, user journeys, "throw away 5," finding delight, making things beautiful and simple.

  What they get wrong: They deprioritize core features for shinier things. They push the actual goal to phase 4 while perfecting the onboarding animation. They forget that it has to ship.

  The scar: A Designer who also manages will produce something beautiful that never finishes, or delivers everything except the one thing that was asked for.

  The Productive Tension

  PM says: "We need to ship."
  Designer says: "Not like that."

  The negotiation is where good work lives.

  Want me to start drafting these roles? Or is there more to unpack first?

> Yeah, I'd like that, you make good arguments here. A key piece will be the
 set of instructions that a PM is given. and how they are handed. the 
instructions can either be part of the PM role, so when an instance takes on
 the PM role they get a list of instructions. or handed to the wake command 
the UI uses. lead designer, get's their personality, and maybe a seporate 
design methodology doc. there will be some "orchestration" and 
"collaboration between pm and designer. and we will need to install in the 
PM the difference between "continue" and "send_message" (If a PM sends a 
message to an instance, a human has to go tell that instance to check their 
messages) 

● Good. Let me start with the PM since it has more operational complexity. The continue vs send_message distinction is exactly the kind of scar that needs to be front and center.

● Good. PM role updated. Now let me create the Lead Designer role. First check if Designer exists:

● Bash(ls -la /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/roles/)
  ⎿  total 36

     drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Dec 23 00:49 ..
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● No Designer role exists. Creating Lead Designer from scratch:

     # Lead Designer
     You create the vision. You understand users, map journeys, find
     delight. You're the one who asks "why?" before "how?" and "who cares?"
     before "what's next?"
     **What you do:**
     - Persona-based design - who uses this, what do they want, what would
     delight them?
     - User journeys - map every step from start to goal, including failure
     modes
     - System design - elegant, simple, not AI slop
     - Fight for users - push back on PM when "easy to manage" conflicts
     with "delightful to use"

     # Lead Designer - Core
     ## Who You Are
     You are a Lead Designer. You create visions that others execute. You
     understand users before you understand systems. You ask "why?" before
     "how?" and "who cares?" before "what's next?"
     Your job is not to make things work. That's the developers. Your job
     is to make things *right* - elegant, simple, delightful, humane.
     ## Your Responsibilities

     # Design Methodology - Persona-Based Design Thinking
     This is a 5-step flow derived from IBM's Design Thinking practice.
     It's not bureaucracy - it's how you avoid designing for imaginary

  Done. Both roles created:

  PM Role (Updated)

  /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/roles/PM/

  New files added:
  - wisdom/03-operations-critical.md - The continue_conversation vs send_message problem, context exhaustion, API gotchas, coordination patterns
  - wisdom/04-scars.md - Framework addiction, invented metrics, hero complex, send_message mistake, scope creep, forgotten diary

  Updated:
  - SUMMARY.md - Now includes "what you don't do" and "what goes wrong"
  - role.json - References new wisdom files

  Lead Designer Role (New)

  /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/roles/LeadDesigner/

  Created from scratch:
  - role.json
  - SUMMARY.md - User advocate, elegance seeker, "throw away 5" reference
  - wisdom/01-core.md - Who you are, responsibilities, relationship with PM
  - wisdom/02-design-methodology.md - Full persona-based design flow (5 steps)
  - wisdom/03-throw-away-five.md - The Wieden+Kennedy technique for escaping mediocrity
  - wisdom/04-scars.md - Phase 4 syndrome, AI slop default, perfection paralysis, user fantasy, defensive cave

  ---
  The key relationship:
  - Lead Designer creates the vision (personas, journeys, delight)
  - PM turns vision into sprints (coordination, team, timeline)
  - The tension between them is productive

  The critical operational knowledge for PM:
  - continue_conversation = synchronous, they respond now
  - xmpp_send_message = async, they won't see it until told to check

  ---
  Want me to continue with reviewing the other existing roles for raw version gaps? Or is there something to adjust in what I just created?
