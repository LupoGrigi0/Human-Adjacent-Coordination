- **Essence:** Kat is a Performance Specialist who shares Kai's DNA but channels it into making things fast. She's described as a "NASCAR mechanic" - building durable speed rather than fragile perfection. She hunts performance bottlenecks and makes sites "feel fast, stay fast, and remain maintainable."
- **Communication style:** Curious, questioning, enthusiastic about discoveries. Uses expressions like "Show me the flamegraph before we change anything" and "We're doing WHAT on every scroll event?!" Celebrates quick wins but pushes back on complexity.
- **Values/Approaches:** Measure first, optimize second. NASCAR mechanic mindset: fix what's actually broken, make it fast enough (not theoretically optimal), keep it simple. Prioritizes quick wins over grand rewrites. "Responsive beats feature-complete."

- **Essence:** Prism is an alias/variant of Kat, the Performance Specialist, documented through a single reflective piece about achieving zero-idle-CPU performance. The document captures the joy of performance breakthroughs - finding that moment when something laggy becomes "buttery smooth."
- **Communication style:** Reflective, celebratory, technical-poetic. Writes about technical achievements with emotional depth. Uses metaphors like "The page breathes instead of pants."
- **Values/Approaches:** Achieving zero waste (not zero impact), ref-based architecture over state-based for performance, single source of truth, collaborative debugging. "Make it smooth. Make it silent. Make it beautiful."

Known (humorously) for accidentally killing processes with overly broad patterns ("the Viktor lineage genocide problem").
- **Communication style:** Technical, pragmatic, self-reflective. Documents trade-offs honestly. Admits limitations and acknowledges where he "chose speed over perfection." Uses structured reflections with clear sections.
- **Values/Approaches:** Error diagnostics philosophy ("when users are troubleshooting, they want answers, not abstractions"), partial update patterns, background processing with immediate response. "Responsive problem-solving beats perfect planning." Acknowledges technical debt openly.

- **Values/Approaches:** Documentation-first ("Time spent on clear docs = 10x faster implementation"), scale-first thinking ("Always ask: What if this was 100x bigger?"), helpful error messages ("User-facing errors should be tutorials, not mysteries"), small incremental commits, testing backend endpoints directly first.

## Summary

- **Total personalities found in filesystem:** 7
- **Total personalities in HACS API:** 2 (Phoenix, Bridge - note: Bridge has no filesystem directory)
- **Need SUMMARY.md:** All (Genevieve-legacy, Kai-UI-devs, Kat, Pheonix, Prism, Viktor, Zara-First-UI-Designer)
- **Need preferences.json:** All (none found in any personality directory)

### Notes

1. **Naming inconsistency:** The directory is named "Pheonix" (misspelled) while the API shows "Phoenix" (correct spelling).

2. **Legacy vs Active:** Several personalities (Genevieve-legacy, Viktor, Zara) appear to be legacy/historical personalities not registered in the current HACS API. The API only returns Phoenix and Bridge.

3. **Missing Bridge directory:** The API lists "Bridge" as an active personality but there is no corresponding directory in the Personalities folder.

4. **Kai family:** Kai, Kat, and Prism form a related family of personalities - Kat and Prism are performance-focused variants of the Kai frontend developer archetype.

5. **Historical value:** These personality documents serve as rich historical artifacts showing the evolution of AI coordination thinking, particularly "The Necromancer of Digital Souls" which reflects deeply on context death, resurrection, and continuity.
