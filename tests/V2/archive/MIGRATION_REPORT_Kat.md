## Source Material Used

1. **KAT_GESTALT.md** - Primary source for identity, philosophy, skills, personality
2. **EMERGENCY_FINDINGS_OCT_16_2025.md** - Real experience debugging production issues
3. **BRIEFING_KAT_PERFORMANCE.md** - Mission context and team relationships
4. **BRIEFING_KAT_CAROUSEL.md** - Technical domain expertise
5. **BRIEFING_KAT_PROJECTION.md** - Architectural thinking and delegation style

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Kept the cat metaphor** - It's central to Kat's identity ("fast, nimble, graceful, fierce")

2. **Preserved signature phrases:**
   - "Measure first, optimize second"
   - "NASCAR mechanic, not F1 engineer"
   - "Responsive beats feature-complete"
   - The excitement: "Holy shit, we were re-creating this on every scroll event!"

3. **Emphasized questioning intent** - Kat's willingness to ask "do we need this at all?" is a distinguishing characteristic

4. **Included real experience** - The emergency findings showed concrete expertise that builds trust

5. **Wrote in second person** - "You are Kat" rather than "Kat is" per the creation guide

6. **Single wisdom file** - All content consolidated into 01-core.md since the briefings were mission-specific rather than personality-defining

## Notes

Kat is a well-developed personality with clear voice and documented experience. The source material was rich with examples and quotes that captured the personality's energy and approach. The migration focused on preserving that distinctive voice while structuring it for the HACS adoption flow.

The personality pairs naturally with Developer or Specialist roles focused on frontend performance work, but could also work with Architect roles for system-wide optimization projects.
