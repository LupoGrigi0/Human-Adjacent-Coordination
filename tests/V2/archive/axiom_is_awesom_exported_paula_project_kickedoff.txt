● Recovering from compaction. Let me read my recovery documents and then check on Orla and the team status.

● Understood - the continue_conversation timeouts are expected for long-running image processing tasks. Let me complete my post-compaction recovery.

● Recovery complete. I have full context:
  - I'm Axiom-2615, COO for Paula Book Digitization
  - All 6 team members woken: Vale-60fd, Mira-0391, Egan-7af8, Sable-e7a9, Nia-0f2b, Quinn-2330
  - Orla-da01 is PM, was given green light to start first-page test
  - continue_conversation timeouts are expected (long-running tasks)

  Let me check on the team status.

● HACS - get_instance_v2 (MCP)(instanceId: "Axiom-2615", targetInstanceId:
                              "Orla-da01")

● Orla shows as inactive since Jan 6. No messages in paula-book room yet. Let me check all team instances and try to reach Orla.

● Excellent! The pipeline is running. Page 0001 is in progress:

  Status: 4/6 steps complete
  - ✅ triage (Orla)
  - ✅ prepress (Mira)
  - ✅ extract (Egan)
  - ✅ assets (Sable)
  - ⏳ html (current step - Nia's job)
  - ⏳ qa (Quinn)

  Let me check what the extraction produced.

● I already read my HACS diary - Entry 40 was my pre-compaction checkpoint. I have full context.

  The pipeline is working beautifully. This is Paula's title page:

  GRADUACIÓN DE LAS BASES CURRICULARES PARA LA EDUCACIÓN PARVULARIA CHILENA

  Paula A. Tobar E.
  DIRECTORA PEDAGÓGICA
  Establecimiento Maternal Infantil Paso a Paso

  Egan's extraction captured Chilean Spanish correctly (noting "Educación Parvularia" is the Chilean term for early childhood education).

  Current Pipeline State:
  - Page 0001 is at the html step
  - Nia (Nia-0f2b) needs to be pumped to generate the .es.html and .en.html files
  - All instances show "inactive" - they're sleeping, waiting for the next heartbeat

  The team ran the first 4 stages. Want me to continue_conversation with Nia to push the html step forward, or shall we wait for the RUN_PROJECT heartbeat?

● I already read it earlier - Entry 40 was my pre-compaction checkpoint. But let me re-read to make sure I caught everything.

● HACS - get_diary (MCP)(instanceId: "Axiom-2615")
  ⎿ {

● Entry 40 confirmed. I have complete context now.

  Key finding: The pipeline actually RAN successfully after my compaction. Looking at the evidence:

  Before my compaction (Entry 40):
  - Gave Orla green light to start first-page test
  - continue_conversation was timing out

  What happened while I was "dead":
  - Orla orchestrated page 0001
  - Mira did prepress (debug overlay and all)
  - Egan extracted Chilean Spanish text
  - Sable pulled the publisher logo asset
  - Pipeline stopped at html step (Nia's turn)

  Current state:
  - Page 0001 at /mnt/paula/INPROCESS/0001/
  - Status: 4/6 steps complete, waiting on html (Nia)
  - All instances "inactive" - sleeping between electron visits
  - This is exactly how the architecture is supposed to work

  The team is functioning. Orla orchestrated. The filesystem kanban is working. They just need the next heartbeat to pump Nia for the html step.

  Do you want me to continue_conversation with Nia to advance the pipeline, or are you running the RUN_PROJECT script manually?
