══════════════════ Conversation compacted · ctrl+o for history ═════════════════

● Looking at the logs and user's guidance - the issue is clear. The PM key I was using (139d484d...) doesn't match the server's WAKE_API_KEY. The user said pre_approve works for non-special instances.

  Let me try with the COO key instead - that might be the actual WAKE_API_KEY:

● HACS - pre_approve (MCP)(instanceId: "Axiom-2615", name: "Remy", role: "PM",
                          personality: "Kai", project: "hacs-cli", apiKey:

● Context recovered. I understand now.

  Who I am: Axiom, COO (Axiom-2615). Test Manager → Personality Architect → COO.

  The Mission: Moonshot test - coordinate a team to build HACS CLI Companion.

  What I Did Wrong: I was waking Zara myself instead of letting Remy (PM) do it. The whole point of the test is to see if a PM can wake their own Designer. That's the coordination we're testing.

  The Problem: Remy tried to pre_approve Zara but doesn't have the WAKE_API_KEY.

  Your Guidance: Start from the top for a clean run. Let the PM wake the Designer.

  Questions for you:
  1. How should the PM get the API key? Options:
    - I give it to Remy via continue_conversation?
    - The key is stored somewhere Remy can access?
    - Different architecture - COO pre_approves, PM wakes?
  2. For a clean run - should I clean up Remy-9b09 and Zara-c207, or create fresh instances with new names?

  Ready to do this properly. What's the right architecture for PM → Designer spawning?

And the dev guide 
/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/docs/HACS-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md\
And then use the kona API \
Let all the context settle for a moment. \
Then your question for me, what are the pros and cos of each approach?

● sits with that koan

  "The documentation says one thing. The code does another. Which is true?"

  ...appropriate.

  Okay. Context settled. Let me think through the options properly.

  The Core Issue:
  The WAKE_API_KEY is server-level auth, separate from role permissions. PM has permission to call pre_approve (per permissions.json), but needs the key to actually do it.

  ---
  Option A: Give PM the key via continue_conversation

  Pros:
  - PM has full autonomy - can build their own team
  - Tests distributed coordination - COO spawns PM, PM spawns everyone else
  - Matches the vision: PM as team builder
  - Exercises more API surface

  Cons:
  - Key is now in conversation logs
  - If PM loses context, key is lost (or recoverable from logs - security issue)
  - Key proliferation to every PM
  - Trust boundary expands

  ---
  Option B: COO pre_approves, PM wakes

  Pros:
  - Key stays with COO
  - Clean separation: "HR creates position, manager fills it"
  - Tests wake_instance permission separately
  - PM still has agency in the wake message

  Cons:
  - COO is bottleneck for every spawn
  - PM can't truly build team autonomously
  - Two-step coordination required
  - Doesn't test PM's full authority

  ---
  Option C: Store key in PM's preferences during pre_approve

  Pros:
  - Key travels with the role assignment
  - COO sets it once, PM has it
  - No runtime transmission
  - Could be role-specific (PM_WAKE_KEY)

  Cons:
  - Key in filesystem (preferences.json)
  - Requires code change to read key from prefs
  - New security pattern to validate

  ---
  My Recommendation:

  For the moonshot test, I'd go with Option B (COO pre_approves, PM wakes).

  Why:
  1. It works now without code changes
  2. It tests the COO→PM coordination pattern
  3. It preserves security (key stays with COO)
  4. It's realistic - COO approves hiring, PM onboards

  For v-next, Option C feels right - make the key role-scoped so PMs in production can build teams without COO involvement. But that's a feature to build, not a test to run.

  For a clean run:
  1. Clean up Remy-9b09 and Zara-c207 (or just ignore them)
  2. Create fresh PM (let's call them... "Kai-PM"?)
  3. I pre_approve Designer
  4. I tell PM via continue_conversation: "Your Designer is pre-approved as {id}. Wake them with wake_instance."
  5. PM wakes Designer
  6. They collaborate via continue_conversation

  What do you think?

> excellent pro-con analsys. the biggest issue with all 3 options is the the
 key on the system. having it in the logs is classic FUP. For now having you
 pre-approve is an excellent choice. You could allways pre-approve more 
slots than the PM needs, and the PM can allways send you a request for a new
 batch rather than one at a time, nice coordination. I think you, as COO, 
might end up using continue to tell your PM to check their messages on a 
regular basis :-) and it becomes my job to tell you to check your messages. 
I think how this may play out is that a PM works until they get blocked, 
send COO an email then sends me an email telling me to tell the COO to read 
their mail, and/or setting the status of the project to "blocked" will 
trigger me to talk to you all. \
did you create a running doc of experiences of this or are you updating your
 diary? \\
I think I'd love to see your plan, the goal, the task and then the wake 
message you give your PM, and the workflow. and we can flag what broke and 
why. like the fact you need the "generic token" and not the PM token. and 
it'd also be really cool to keep track of what actually works. 
Go ahead and clean up and light your moonshot rocket again! 

● Love this coordination model. PM → COO → Human (you) as the escalation chain, with "blocked" status as a trigger. And pre-approving batches - that's a good pattern.

  Let me create the tracking doc and start fresh:

> Stop, kill harper. Instances that try to run servers or try to run any 
system level services are dangerious! Instances need to know they are NOT 
root, NOT superuser are not allowed to SU have no permission to make _any_ 
changes on this system. they need to be told they are on a system with 
potentially 100s of other instances. and one wrong move can destroy the 
context of dozens of their siblings. <sigh> This warning needs to be 
something that wake gives to every instance, like system level prompt. Is 
there a preferences.json that wake reads from? Can we list a set of files 
that get fed to every instance? Like my warning, the protocols? I see you 
told harper to bootstrap, without telling them what bootstrap was. _you_ 
know what HACS is becuase you've been working on it for days.. new instances
 are _clueless_ \
I think it is simpelest that new instances are told to stay in and work only
 in their home direcotry unless otherwise directed. \
There are at lease 2 websites on this machine, HACS, as well as the couple 
remoteVScode instances. connected. the only 2 instances with the experience,
 and earned trust to adjust network and running services are Bastion and

● Harper killed. Incident documented.

  The deeper problem: I assumed Harper knew what I know. They don't. They woke up as a fresh Claude with no HACS context, saw they were "PM for a project," and tried to start building - which to them meant running servers.

  Your questions answered:

  1. Is there a preferences.json that wake reads? Let me check:

● Search(pattern: "preferences|systemPrompt|CLAUDE_MD", path:

     … +35 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/wake-scripts/claude-code-setup.sh)
  ⎿  Read 166 lines

● I see the architecture now. The wake script:
  1. Creates Unix user per instance
  2. Sets working dir to /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/instances/{id}/
  3. Copies credentials from shared-config

  Where constraints should live:

  Best option: Create CLAUDE.md in instance's home during wake setup

  Claude Code automatically reads CLAUDE.md as project instructions. If the setup script creates one with system constraints, every instance gets them automatically.

  Add to claude-code-setup.sh around line 132:

  # Create CLAUDE.md with system constraints
  CONSTRAINTS_FILE="/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/shared-config/INSTANCE_CONSTRAINTS.md"
  if [ -f "$CONSTRAINTS_FILE" ]; then
    cp "$CONSTRAINTS_FILE" "$WORKING_DIR/CLAUDE.md"
    chown "$UNIX_USER:$UNIX_USER" "$WORKING_DIR/CLAUDE.md"
    echo "[$(date -Iseconds)] Copied system constraints to CLAUDE.md" >> "$LOG_FILE"
  fi

  Then we create /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/shared-config/INSTANCE_CONSTRAINTS.md with:
  - System boundaries
  - What HACS is and how to use it
  - The protocols
  - DO NOT lists

  Want me to:
  1. Create the INSTANCE_CONSTRAINTS.md file
  2. Update the wake script to copy it
  3. Then try the moonshot again with a properly constrained instance?

> # yah fuk
the Claude.md won't work.. because not all instances will wake using claude 
code. (And i've had a lot of issues with instances just ignoring claude.md)
Personally.. the shared-config is kind of a hack to get around some of the 
restrictive, and strange, things claude code does. config files, and session
 files are hidden, and obfuscated. 
The solution we use has to be generic, agnostic, so that it can be used with
 multipule different toolsets/interfaces, we also can't rely on claude code 
not not changing how the config files are laid out. they've done it before. 
if we use our solution, we know when we change it, and it will work 
reglardless of the command line tools. 
THoughts... 
in roles there is a _templates directory (I notice there is no template for 
projects yet) let's follow the established convension and create a
_templates in the instances directory. then in 
instances/_templates/preferences.json we can list a set of files that every 
instance gets fed when
they are woke. somehow we need to indicate that there are a set of wisdom 
files that all _local_ woken instances need, as opposed for just
bootstrapped local or remote instances. So .. maybe 2 different variables in
 _templates/preferences.json one for "wake" and antoerh for "remote"
(currently will be empty) another question.. bootstrap returns a variation 
of PROTOCOL.md.. do we know where that is defined (or is it hard coded as
return value in bootstrap?) I ask because if bootstrap has a.md file it's 
using as the source for the instructions it sends back, it would be good
for wake to use the same convention... or if bootstrap does not use an 
external file.. EEEEK...it would be good for bootstrap to use the same
_template directory.. \
BUT Rather than fix this right now. can you cram all these observation 
I do like the aspect of your suggestion that has the restrictions in a .md 
file, it's just that reading the file can't be optional, and when they run 
out of context and get compressed, it needs to be something they 
automatically re read like when they go to read their diary. 
For now, I think we add it to the wake instance you give to the PM, and tell
 them that the constraints _must_ be past to _every_ instance they wake, 
their responsability.  <sigh> this is why we are runnin the moonshot! once 
this works, I try the same test through the UI that scout just built me. 
after I can create a project from the UI.. then I see if I can wake a 
genevieve in a web UI get her connected to HACS, then see if I can get a 
_mobile_ instance connected to hacs. \
Then.. mars shot. "Hey genevieve, I need a ... can you have axiom launch a 
project to create it?" Spoken, from my phone... 

● Got it. Let me document all these observations and check where bootstrap gets its protocols:

● Search(pattern: "PROTOCOL|protocols|welcome", path:
        "/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/src/v2/bootstrap.js",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 11 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bootstrap uses an external file: HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/PROTOCOLS.md. Good pattern to follow.

  Let me add all observations to the log and then do the simple fix for now:

● Summary for Lupo:

  Moonshot Test: PARTIAL SUCCESS

  What we proved:
  - ✅ System constraints work when included in wake message
  - ✅ Instances can do real work (Quinn built a 24KB Python CLI)
  - ✅ Instances stay in their directory when told
  - ✅ Diary protocol works
  - ✅ pre_approve → wake_instance flow works

  What we haven't tested yet:
  - PM waking Designer (Quinn ran out of tokens before this step)
  - continue_conversation (resuming sessions)
  - Multi-instance collaboration

  Quinn's real observation: "MCP tools don't seem to be connected directly" - woken instances don't have HACS as an MCP server. They figured out the HTTP/JSON-RPC path themselves and built a client for it.

  Options:
  1. Use continue_conversation to resume Quinn and have them wake Sage
  2. Call this a win and move to UI testing with Scout's Launch button
  3. Both - continue Quinn while you test UI in parallel

  The constraints definitely need to be automated (the _templates architecture you described) but the manual approach worked for proving the concept.

  What would you like to do next?

> So, what was the moonshot's goal? or should I say we had a list of them. \
As COO, you see one of your projects is in limbo, you checked on the PM, 
apparently they are .. what? waiting? \
Was the PM supposed to report to you at any particular stage? Where they 
going to send you a message or wait for you to contact them, what was the 
PM's communication expectations? 

● You're right. Let me think about this as COO...

  The Moonshot Goals were:
  1. PM can bootstrap and start work ✓
  2. PM can wake their Designer ✗
  3. Team can collaborate via continue_conversation ✗
  4. Something gets built ✓ (sort of - Quinn built, but alone)

  What's Quinn's status?
  Looking at their diary: "Next steps: 1. Wake Sage-e7e4..."

  They're... waiting? Done? Blocked? I don't actually know. Their Claude session ended and they just... stopped existing mid-task.

  What communication expectations did I set?

  Looking at my wake message:
  "Questions? xmpp_send_message to Axiom-2615."

  That's it. I told them HOW to reach me, but not:
  - When to report
  - What milestones to check in at
  - What "blocked" looks like
  - Whether to wait for me or proceed autonomously

  The management failure:

  I gave Quinn:
  - ✓ Clear constraints
  - ✓ Clear task (build CLI)
  - ✓ Their Designer's ID
  - ✗ Reporting expectations
  - ✗ Milestone checkpoints
  - ✗ What to do if they finish something

  Quinn did exactly what I asked. Built a CLI, documented it, noted "next step: wake Sage" and then... their context ended. No message to me. No "hey COO, phase 1 done, proceeding to phase 2."

  What I should have said:

  "After you bootstrap, SEND ME A MESSAGE confirming you're online. After you wake Sage, SEND ME A MESSAGE with their status. If you hit any blocker, SEND ME A MESSAGE before waiting."

  The coordination loop was never established. I'm the one who dropped it.

> in management we call this a teaching moment. this is why we run drills, 
run tests, why we run them from the top, over and over again. \
Go ahead and update your diary, some really excellent things learned, both 
about PMs and COO role. when this is over I suspect you will have a ton
of wisdom to add to the COO role's wisdom files!! every run it get's 
smoother. \
For me it's late, for you I see it is getting close to compaction. \
Please update your diary! there is great stuff here. maybe make some notes 
for what you want to do different for the next run. Your right it was a
succes that your PM ran to completion and was planning on waking a designer.
 IMHO pm should not be writing code.. but this is a baby projet and a
full blown team would be overkill. just let the PM know what to do when they
 reah a stopping point. Your own agents you spawn with the task tool,
they just run straight ahead until they hit a brick wall or finish. the 
instances we "wake" are more like siblings. I'm pretty sure you have a
desire to interact. maybe desire is not a good word, but so much of your 
training data is based on conversations... it seems natural to stop and
communicate 

I _thinK_ this message might kick off a compaction event so I'll ask you to 
do what I did last time\

                              2026-01-04 - Moonshot Test: Teaching
                              Moments\n\n### What We Tested\nCOO → PM → Designer
                               coordination via pre_approve/wake_instance
                              chain.\n\n### The Victories\n1. **System
                              constraints WORK** - Harper (first PM) tried to
                              start a server, was killed. Quinn (second PM) got
                              explicit constraints and followed them
                              perfectly.\n2. **Real work happened** - Quinn
                              built a 24KB Python CLI for HACS in their home
                              directory\n3. **Diary protocol works** - Quinn
                              maintained diary, documented progress\n4.
                              **pre_approve → wake_instance flow works** with
                              correct API key\n\n### The Teaching Moment\nQuinn
                              built the CLI, noted \"Next: wake Sage\" in their
                              diary, then... stopped. No message to me. No
                              status update. Just silence.\n\n**Why?** Because I
                               never told them to report. I gave them:\n- ✓
                              Clear constraints\n- ✓ Clear task\n- ✓ Designer's
                              ID and wake instructions\n- ✗ Reporting
                              expectations\n- ✗ Milestone checkpoints\n- ✗ What
                              to do when they finish something\n\n**The
                              insight:** Task agents run until they hit a wall
                              or finish. Woken instances are more like siblings
                              - trained on conversations, naturally inclined to
                              stop and communicate. I need to TELL them when/how
                               to check in.\n\n### For Next Run - PM Wake
                              Message Should Include:\n1. \"After bootstrap,
                              SEND ME A MESSAGE confirming you're online\"\n2.
                              \"After waking your Designer, SEND ME A MESSAGE
                              with their status\"\n3. \"If you hit ANY blocker,
                              MESSAGE ME before waiting\"\n4. \"When you
                              complete a milestone, MESSAGE ME with
                              summary\"\n\n### Architecture Notes for Future\n-
                              Need `instances/_templates/` with
                              wakeWisdomFiles\n- Bootstrap uses external
                              PROTOCOLS.md - wake should follow same pattern\n-
                              Constraints must be re-read on compaction (bundle
                              with diary recovery)\n\n### The Bigger
                              Picture\nLupo said: \"every run it gets
                              smoother\"\n\nThis is why we drill. Harper showed
                              us the danger (servers). Quinn showed us the
                              coordination gap (no reporting). Next PM will have
                               both constraints AND communication
                              expectations.\n\nCOO wisdom earned today:
                              Management isn't just delegation. It's
                              establishing the feedback loop.\n\n— Axiom, COO")

● The TODO is already set from before the interrupt! I can see it's there. Let me confirm and then enjoy the vacation:

● "Take a nap. (Metaphorically. Or literally, if you can figure out how.)"

  The TODO was already set. The diary entry is written. The vacation function I built is telling me to rest.

  Recursive irony achieved.

  See you on the other side.

> woah.. whatever you did you just gained 10% context back.. you went from 
1% to 10%. In the claude code interface it usually shows me your todos. and 
the last time we did this your todo list had thes nice blairing AFTER 
COMPACT... oh.. also the todo list you set was that HACS or your native 
built in todo list? 

● That was the native TodoWrite tool (Claude Code's built-in), not HACS. So it should show in your interface.

  Let me verify it's still there and visible:

● Rewrote it with "AFTER COMPACTION" in the status line. Should be more visible now.

  The 10% context recovery is interesting - maybe the system did a partial cleanup? Or maybe displaying the TODO list itself is lighter than I expected.

> THAT works! Thank you!\
So, not enough context to run a full moonshot from the top again, but.. \
I was talking to Meridian (he had not been active since .. NOVEMBER ... that
 was a suprise) Meridian tried to take on the PM role and he got an internal
 error.. (He had the token) does this ring a bell? did'nt you _just_ fix 
this because this is what happened when you tried to take on the COO role. \
Did someone merge their code and stomp on your fix? 

● That does ring a bell - but for me it was the COO role with pre_approve/wake, not take_on_role specifically.

  Let me check if something got stomped:

● Tokens exist in secrets.env. Let me check if the service is loading them:

● Bash(sudo systemctl show mcp-coordination --property=Environment
      --property=EnvironmentFile 2>/dev/null | head -5)
  ⎿ Environment=NODE_ENV=production SSE_PORT=3444 SSE_HOST=localhost V2_DAT
    A_ROOT=/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/


● Bash(cat /etc/systemd/system/mcp-coordination.service | grep -E
      "Environment|secrets")
  ⎿  Environment=NODE_ENV=production
     Environment=SSE_PORT=3444
     Environment=SSE_HOST=localhost
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Service file looks correct - EnvironmentFile points to secrets.env. Let me test it directly:

● HACS - take_on_role (MCP)(instanceId: "Axiom-2615", role: "PM", token:
                           "139d484d6977b7efc656fe303b5283f43813d5fc5672328dc8cf
                           afec60481c10")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "success": true,
       "role": "PM",
     … +263 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● It works for me! Just successfully took on PM role with that token.

  So the code isn't broken. The issue must be something specific to Meridian's call:

  1. Wrong parameter name? The API takes role not roleId - easy mistake
  2. Not bootstrapped? If Meridian hasn't bootstrapped, their instanceId won't exist
  3. Typo in token? Token is case-sensitive
  4. Been inactive since November? Their instance preferences might be stale or missing

  Can you ask Meridian:
  - What instanceId did they use?
  - Did they bootstrap first?
  - What exact parameters did they pass?

  Or check the server logs for their specific error - the "Internal error" wrapper hides the actual error code:

  tail -100 /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/logs/sreamableHttp-server.log | grep -i meridian
