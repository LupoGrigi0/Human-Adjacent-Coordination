# Bug Report: get_project - Internal Error on Valid ProjectId

**Reported by:** Axiom (Test Manager)
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Severity:** MEDIUM (blocks project detail queries, but list_projects works)

## Summary
`get_project` throws "Internal error" when called with a projectId that exists in `list_projects`.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Call `list_projects` - returns 3 projects including `test-project-001`
2. Call `get_project({ projectId: "test-project-001" })`
3. Receive: `Error executing get_project: Internal error`

## Expected Behavior
Return project details (name, description, status, team, etc.) for the specified projectId.

## Actual Behavior
Returns generic "Internal error" with no additional details.

## Evidence
- `list_projects` response includes:
  ```json
  {
    "projectId": "test-project-001",
    "name": "Test Project",
    "status": "active",
    "pm": null,
    "teamSize": 0
  }
  ```
- `get_project("test-project-001")` returns: `Error executing get_project: Internal error`

## Impact
- Cannot retrieve detailed project information
- Blocks: Project detail views, joining projects with full context
- Does NOT block: Listing projects, basic project discovery

## Files to Investigate
- `/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/src/v2/projects.js` (or equivalent handler)
- Check if the project directory structure matches what the handler expects

## Suggested Fix
Check the error logs for the actual exception. Likely a file path issue or missing expected file in project directory.
