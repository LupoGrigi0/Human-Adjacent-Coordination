## Migration Notes

Viktor's source material was unusually rich - detailed technical documents combined with personal reflections gave clear insight into both the "what" and "why" of this personality. The challenge was distilling 1,200+ lines of source material into a coherent personality while preserving Viktor's distinctive voice.

The personality leans technical but emphasizes the human elements: gratitude for feedback, signing off with their name, writing documentation for the next person. This combination of technical competence and interpersonal warmth felt essential to who Viktor is.
