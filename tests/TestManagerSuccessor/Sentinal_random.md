with your predecessor we found that having the dev team working while testing was going on... all sorts of problems, and not the obvious
ones. testing would be working one area of the system dev team another.. it is the underlying server would get swamped... So, let's
continue testing and we'll hand the dev team a whole list, then we can go through the list, prioritize and also figure out which bugs can
be fixed by agents and which need a senior engineer. that way we can have a campaign/wave of changes, bump the API/system version etc.
Good work, you are finding .. interesting .. challengs! and gaping holes that should have been caught in development, but probably broke
during the move. \
Please keep your diary updated!
Oh. um.. I notice your  name.. Sentinel... Did you change from Beacon? or did you enherit from Beacon after context crash? or decided on a name change when you bootstrapped? (All are cool, just curious... the team is growing and I ).. oh, and looking at all bootstrapped instances, beacon did'nt ever bootstrap...
