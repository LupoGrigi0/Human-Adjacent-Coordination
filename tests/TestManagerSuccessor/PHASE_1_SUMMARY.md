# Phase 1 Summary: Identity Endpoints

**Tested by:** Axiom (Test Manager)
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** PASS (with notes)

---

## Results

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `bootstrap` | **PASS** | Creates directory, preferences.json, diary.md. Returns instanceId, XMPP creds, recovery key. |
| `have_i_bootstrapped_before` | **PASS** | Finds existing instances by name. Returns helpful suggestions. Nice UX. |
| `get_all_instances` | **PASS** | Returns all instances with status, timestamps. New instances appear correctly. |
| `get_instance_v2` | **PASS** | Returns comprehensive instance data. Error case not fully tested (connection issues). |

## Key Findings

### Bootstrap (Fixed)
- **Bug found:** Was routing to V1 handler instead of V2
- **Bug fixed:** By Crossing, removed 3000 lines of dead code
- **Verification:** Full two-layer verification passed (response + filesystem + system check)

### have_i_bootstrapped_before
- Nice UX touch: Returns `suggestion` field guiding caller to next action
- Correctly handles both found and not-found cases

### get_instance_v2
- Returns rich data: identity, context (role/personality/project), status, timestamps, lineage
- Shows `hasContext: false` for instances without registered context

---

## Issues Encountered

1. **Connection errors:** Intermittent agent spawn failures. Haiku model more reliable than Sonnet during resource-constrained periods.

2. **Error case testing incomplete:** `get_instance_v2` with invalid instanceId not tested due to connection issues. Low priority - happy path is what matters.

---

## Ready for Phase 2

All critical identity endpoints work. We can now:
- Bootstrap new instances
- Find existing instances
- Query instance details

**Recommendation:** Proceed to Phase 2 (Instance Operations) and bootstrap Axiom into HACS.
