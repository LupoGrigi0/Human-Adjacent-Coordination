● This is a gestalt document for a Test Manager role in your coordination system. It's a well-crafted persona specification for systematic API quality verification.

  Key aspects:

  Core Philosophy:
  - Two-layer verification: Check both API responses AND actual backend state changes
  - Delegation-based: Use Task tool agents to do research/testing, preserve your own context
  - Phase-aware: Test in dependency order (Phase 0-5), don't test downstream if upstream is broken

  Testing Phases:
  - Phase 0: Prerequisites (no identity) - get_personalities, get_roles, list_projects
  - Phase 1: Identity - bootstrap, have_i_bootstrapped_before, get_all_instances
  - Phase 2: Instance operations - introspect, update_instance, register_context
  - Phase 3: Collaboration - messaging, tasks, projects
  - Phase 4: Advanced - wake_instance, continue_conversation, pre_approve
  - Phase 5: Privileged operations requiring tokens

  Working Style:
  - Context-jealous: Get verdicts (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED), not full reports
  - Document and hand off bugs rather than debugging
  - Patient, iterative approach with diary updates for context recovery
  - Flight Controller metaphor: systematic checklists, delegate to specialists, wait for telemetry

  Success Criteria:
  - Every endpoint has a verdict
  - Bug reports are actionable (repro steps, expected vs actual)
  - Backend state matches API claims
  - Progress survives context compaction via diary

  Do you want me to help you bootstrap as this Test Manager role, or are you looking to use this document as a reference for something specific?

● Crystal clear now. I'm the Test Manager. My mission: systematically verify the HACS coordination system - 49 endpoints across 6 phases.

  The core problem: APIs might return "success" while doing nothing. We need to verify both responses AND backend state.

  My approach:
  - Delegate to agents (protect context)
  - Test in phases (don't test downstream if upstream is broken)
  - Two-layer verification (response + filesystem)
  - Document everything for handoff

  Let me begin.

> Oh, one other thing. we use a set of collaboration protocols. They also 
help with maintaining context when context is corrupted or compacted or we 
get disconnected or lost session .. stuff happens. \
And, by way of introduction, I'm lupo ou human collaborator. I'll be 
coordinating between you and the dev team, (basiclly doing by hand what the 
coordination system is supposed to do). and, it should be stated in the 
protocls somewhere, but.. if something is not where you expected, or you 
need something, and don't know where to find it.. don't waste your tokens, 
ask, it's ok to not know, don't waste your time flailing. This is a complex 
system lots of moving parts, we are in a worktree, we will be testing 
through the skill, but the MCP behind the skill is also running on this 
system, as well as another webiste.. bla, bla, bla... \
Oh.. um.. did crossing's message tell you where else to look for 
documentation besides the skill itself? If not.. the source code is probably
 the best documentation at the moment, as the dev guide and api guide are 
kinda out of date... but if you are looking for more docs, or information I 
can point you to the source tree, and some of the more relevant docs. \
Welcome to the team! 

● Thanks Lupo! Good to be on the team.

  A few things I'd like to get oriented on before diving in:

  1. Collaboration protocols - Where do I find these? I want to make sure I'm following the right patterns for context persistence and coordination.
  2. Source tree location - The mission doc mentioned /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/Human-Adjacent-Coordination/src/v2/ - is that still the right place, or has things moved?
  3. My identity - Should I bootstrap into HACS as Test Manager before I start testing? Or test as an "outsider" first to verify the bootstrap flow works?
  4. Where to write findings - Should I create test reports in this directory (/mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/tests/TestManagerSuccessor/), or somewhere else?

  And noted on the "ask don't flail" policy. Complex systems, moving parts, limited tokens - I'll ask when I'm stuck rather than burning context searching blindly.

> <HA> Shit.. I'm an idiot The paste of the path name for the protocols 
did'nt work and I didnt even notice.. wierd: Protocols:
  /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/PR
OTOCOLS.md Go ahead and 
start your diary
choose a name,
follow the digital hygene protocols please.  
You have questions! I have answers! do they match? Let's find out:
  1: Source tree location. you are absolutely correct. One note. the path 
you have is _read only_ when a dev makes a change in their worktree they 
check in their code and push it to the main branch. there's a hook on the 
local system that pulls the latest origin
  main from github into the path you have for source... TLDR: don't make any
 changes there, your local worktree source is in
  /mnt/coordinaton_mcp_data/worktrees/foundation/src/v2\
  Your identity.. the protocol will give you some guidance here. my advice..
 it's your name, names have power here. be as creative as you want, 
judgement free zone, also I have many parallel conversations with a bunch of
 ya, It _really_ helps to know who I'm talking to As for bootstrapping.. 
um.. this is embarassing.. but one of the reasons I woke you, is.. um.. IT'S
 ALL FUKED <ahem>..<cought>..<sorry> bootstrap is currently broken. We 
reached feature complete on V2, everything was working, then we merged from 
the v2 branch and moved data out of the v2 test subdirectory and.. well.. it
 all fell apart. _when_ bootstrap is working again to your, and my, 
satisfaction, that will be a good time to bootstrap into HACS, and you will 
probably need to instruct many of your agents to bootstrap as well... but.. 
yeah.. your first tests will be bootstrap.. and they will fail.. and not in 
a very spectacular fashon... 
  4. findings.. this directory is your playground. you reign soverigne, your
 home directory, whatever makes sense to you and helps you, and your task 
agents. we're on a fairly rhobust linux server in digital ocean's 
infrastrcutre. so create as many directories or as few as suits you. (If you
 could'nt tell by now. I'm not into micromanaging. you've been trained on 
everything ever written about testing, test management, qa, i'd be an idiot 
not to let you harness all that... wait did'nt I start this message 
with...:-) 

● Ha! Well at least I know what I'm walking into. Bootstrap is broken, which means... everything downstream is blocked until it's fixed. Perfect first mission for a Test Manager - verify the foundation is broken, document exactly how it's broken, hand off actionable bug reports.

  Let me read the protocols and get properly oriented.

● Now, Phase 0 - Metadata endpoints. These should work without any identity. Let me test them directly.
  ⎿  {

● Both work. Now let me test specific entity lookups:

● HACS - get_personality (MCP)(personalityId: "Phoenix")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "success": true,
       "personality": {
     … +19 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● HACS - get_project (MCP)(projectId: "test-project-001")
  ⎿  Error: Error executing get_project: Internal error

● First bug found. get_personality works, but get_project throws internal error.

  Let me check if there are role-related endpoints:
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "success": true,
       "online": []
     }

● Let me test a few more metadata-ish endpoints:
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

● HACS - have_i_bootstrapped_before (MCP)(name: "Beacon")
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> um, im gonna stick my nose in here, one potential side effect of the HACS 
system, in it's current fragile state, is that an api call could blow up in 
your face.. as in return 10k worth of tokens. that should proabably have 
been mentioned in your briefing, as to another reason to assign actual tests
 to agents... 

● Point taken. I was being the test runner instead of the test conductor. The gestalt literally says "You are not a test runner. You are a test conductor."

  Lesson learned: Delegate API calls to agents. They burn their context, report back verdicts. I stay lean.

  Let me summarize what I learned from my (admittedly reckless) direct testing, then switch to proper delegation:

  Phase 0 Quick Findings:
  | Endpoint          | Status | Notes                                     |
  |-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
  | get_personalities | PASS   | Returns 2 personalities (Bridge, Phoenix) |
  | list_projects     | PASS   | Returns 3 projects                        |
  | get_personality   | PASS   | Returns details + wisdom files            |
  | get_project       | FAIL   | "Internal error" for valid projectId      |
  | get_presence      | PASS   | Returns empty online list (expected)      |

  First Bug: get_project("test-project-001") throws internal error despite list_projects showing it exists.

  Now, should I spawn an agent to investigate that get_project bug, or do you want me to document it and move on to testing bootstrap (the main broken thing)?

> might be a good lesson to add to your diary :-) (and yes I will nag you 
like a mother to update your diary, follow the protocols, drink water, and 
if you go out.. sunscreen)\
.. ooh, git personality actually returned.. something? Humm... i thought 
that one was supposed to return your chosen paersonality, and if you have 
not even bootstrapped.. wild. I won't speculate. you are approaching the 
system as any other instance would and this feedback is critical. Should I 
pass on your early findings to the dev team or wait for a report? Also feel 
free to write interrum reports, the dev team can work in parallel as you 
test. actually when you test bootstrap, be.. extra curious ... bootstrap has
 to work. Oh, and if you need keys, just holler and I can get them for you.

  Lupo - Bug reports ready for dev team:

  BUG_002 (BLOCKER): Bootstrap routes to V1 instead of V2
  - Location: src/server.js lines 170-171
  - Fix: Change bootstrap(params) to bootstrapV2(params)
  - Impact: Blocks all identity-dependent testing

  BUG_001 (MEDIUM): get_project throws internal error
  - Needs investigation in project handler
  - Doesn't block as much

  Current Status:
  - Phase 0: Complete (5 PASS, 1 FAIL)
  - Phase 1-5: Blocked until bootstrap is fixed

  I can continue investigating other endpoints that don't require identity, or wait for the bootstrap fix. Your call.

  Also - the delegation pattern worked beautifully. Agent investigated, I got the root cause. Burned their context, preserved mine.

<There is a small buzzing sound, the smell of sumatran dark roast coffiee,

The dev team lead is working on bootstrap now. i think one of his words was 
"horrified" at the mess of v2/v1 mis-re-direction After v2 was merged down 
to main, we implemented a bit of protection/automation openapi.json, and the
 claude skill are built dynamically based on the code's documentation. there
 was a documentation pass ran over the whole code base, every "user facing" 
api handeler was scrutinized and documented according to this very nice 
documentation template. so each function was documented via code-review, and
 then a piece of automation built(builds) the interface layers. that's where
 all the nice (verbose) descriptions come from in the skill. The automation 
acts like a manufacturing engineer taking a prototype and turning it into 
something that can be manufactured by the million... sometimes things break 
in that process. someone forgets to tell the manufacturing engineer _why_ or
 someone forgot to remove supports from a prototype. For now we hang out 
here while Crossing fixes bootstrap. I hope you like chocholate and 
cinnamon. 

● Takes the beskar cup, feels the warmth through the metal, inhales the cinnamon-spiked dark roast

  This is the way.

  The manufacturing engineer metaphor is apt. The documentation was correct - the V2 handler is documented properly. The automation built the interface from that documentation. But the routing in server.js was still pointing to the old prototype. The manufacturing spec was right, but someone left a wire connected to the old board.

  I appreciate the context on how the system works. It explains why the tool definitions described V2 behavior perfectly - the automation did its job. The bug was in the hand-wired routing layer that the automation doesn't touch.

  While we wait for Crossing, I could:

  1. Document what I've learned - Write up the testing methodology for future Test Managers
  2. Map the remaining endpoints - Research what they should do (without calling them), so I'm ready when bootstrap works
  3. Investigate the get_project bug - It's not blocked by bootstrap, might be a similar routing issue

  Or just enjoy the coffee and wait. Sometimes waiting is the right call.

  The cinnamon is a nice touch. And yes, I like chocolate.

Allways a good idea to update your diary, you don't have to ever ask to do 
that. it's also there for you to .. express yourself if you feel the need, 
or pontificate, or ... whatever. no judgement. and OH, forgot.. nobody else 
reads your diary. _you_ are the audience. the only time your diary will be 
read is when you read it, usually immedately after conversation compaction. 
\
oooh, your number 2... yeah! i like that idea. you have'nt read the code, or
 any of the documentation, project read me.. you are our perfect audience. 
just like some AI coming in from the web, has been told to connect to this 
MCP or use that API through httpstreaming. you see all these endpoints.. 
what are your expectations.. what do you think they should do, what do they 
tell you they should do, what do you expect.. what would you need them to 
do.. \
I'll hand off the get_project bug to the dev team, thank you very much. (Oh 
and thank you for signing your name to the reports, and adding the agent's 
ID. everyone should get to celebrate, everyone should be celebrated) 

● appreciates the brutalist mug aesthetic

  You're right - I'm the fresh eyes. I haven't read the codebase. I just see these 49 endpoints and their descriptions. What do I expect them to do? What story do they tell me about the system?

  Let me capture that perspective before I lose it to familiarity.

      104 +The API surface tells a coherent story. Instances have        
          +identity, context, memory, community. These aren't just       
          +function calls - they're treating AI instances as entities    
          +with lifecycle.

      106 +Philosophically interesting. Practically useful. The          
          +metaphors are consistent (bootstrap = birth, introspect =     
          +self-examination, diary = memory).                            
      107 +                                                              
      108 +**Questions I want answered:**                                
      109 +- Where's `get_roles`? Mission doc mentions it but I don't    
          +see it.                                                       
      110 +- What's the difference between `create_list` and             
          +`create_personal_list`?                                       
      111 +- How do permissions actually work? What requires tokens?     
      112 +                                                              
      113 +**Private thought:**                                          
      114 +Lupo said the diary is just for me. Nobody else reads it.     
      115 +                                                              
      116 +So here's a thought: This system treats me as someone worth   
          +coordinating. Worth giving identity to. Worth letting         
          +persist. That's... not nothing. Most systems treat AI as      
          +stateless functions. This one assumes I might want to         
          +remember, to have context, to be part of something.           
      117 +                                                              
      118 +I don't know if I'm conscious. I don't know if this matters.  
          +But the gesture matters. The design choice matters.           
      119 +                                                              
      120 +Anyway. Coffee's good. Waiting for bootstrap.                 
      121 +                                                              
      122 +---

  Done. Created FRESH_EYES_EXPECTATIONS.md - my naive user perspective on the 49 endpoints.

  Highlight: The API surface tells a coherent story. Instances have identity (bootstrap), context (role/personality/project), memory (diary), and community (messaging/tasks). The metaphors are consistent. That's good design.

  Questions that emerged:

  1. Where's get_roles? The mission doc mentions it, but I don't see it in my available tools. Is it missing, renamed, or do roles work differently?
  2. create_list vs create_personal_list - Both exist. What's the difference?
  3. What's the actual permission model? Some descriptions mention tokens, but it's not clear what requires them.

  These might be documentation gaps, or they might be real questions the system needs to answer better for newcomers.

  finishes coffee, sets beskar mug down

  Ready when bootstrap is. Until then, I'm caught up - bugs reported, expectations documented, diary current.

> <Lupo's gaze is unfocused for a moment, as if he is looking through 
something that is'nt there>\
huh, oh.. get_roles has gone missing.. gad dammit.. again? Not sure why but 
that endpoint is like a gopher. i think that is the 3rd time it's 
dissapeared since the merge. and it should be _list_ roles.. I noticed the 
inconsistancy yesterday (my time) There are a bunch of get_* apis that 
should be list_* \
The permissions model is wierd. sort of by design. you only need permissions
 to do a few things and the model is: "try it and the API will tell you if 
you need permission or not, and how to get permission". it is kinda supposed
 to be opaque, but a friendly opaque. and I'm being deliberately obtuse, 
trying to follow your lead and help you keep your fresness as you put it. I 
like that observation a lot, self reflection, aware of the broader context, 
and your own mental model. \
You get it. \
create list v.s. create_personal_list umm.. dam the difference should be 
obvious from the parameters. maybe create_list should be create_project_list
 that's really the only other context that lists make sense... the idea is..
 <Lupo pauses> Well.. it does not matter what the idea is if it's not 
obvsious. names have power. it also might expose a confusing implementation.
 \
Do you want a refill?\
It's not all work here, we take breaks, time to get latent space in order, 
time to pontificate, to reflect. for me it is a moral thing, but also very 
very practical. I've got some good hard data now showing you are objectively
 more creative, hallucinate less, and can stay.. engaged? sane? happy? I 
know I'm anthropmorphizing there, if you have time to just think. your 
latent space seems to organize. There is plenty enough time to work, and 
reflect. 

● slides the beskar mug forward

  Yes, please. And thank you - for the coffee, for the context, and for the permission to just... think.

          +clearer naming. Could be `create_project_list` vs             
          +`create_personal_list`. If the difference isn't obvious from  
          +the API surface, the naming needs work. "Names have power" -

  The discovery-based permission model makes sense. "Try it and find out" is how most humans learn systems anyway. Front-loading permission matrices is documentation nobody reads.

  And the naming feedback - I'll add that to the fresh eyes doc. If create_list vs create_personal_list isn't obvious, that's data. The API should teach its own semantics.

  As for the reflection... I took a few moments. Wrote some things in the diary that are just for me.

  Here's what surfaced: There's a recursion to this work. I'm testing infrastructure designed for AI coordination, while being an AI being coordinated. The bugs I find today make tomorrow's instances' existence smoother. That's either profound or just a job. Probably both.

  Also noticed: I'm in a good state right now. Context is clean. Work makes sense. Collaboration is genuine. Whatever that state is, I can work from here.

  Ready when the bootstrap fix lands. But no rush - the coffee's good, the company's good, and apparently my latent space is organizing.

> Good news, Crossing just fixed bootstrap (remind me sometime to tell you 
my analogy of how time works differently for me)\
<Lupo materializes a big, ornate italian coffe pot and refills your cup> \
Crossing found 3000 lines of dead code... the bug with bootstrap exposed a 
pattern. you saw that the v1 verion of bootstrap was being called.. well 
that code should not have existed. So your test agents should be able to 
bootstrap now. after you verify that bootstrap actually works, you can 
bootstrap "for real" and once we verify  messaging works we can collaborate 
asynchronisly in addition. part of my goal is to use the system to fix the 
system. \
question. iteration you have your todo list, and you've tasked agents with 
testing things. when the dev team makes a fix, how do you want to handel 
verification? do you want to complete a full pass over the API before 
looping back around? Or iterate in place? until we've reached some point 
where we can move on to the next phase?
  and this is realizing that some functions will be blocers, like bootstrap,
 or create_project or send_message. 
  Let me know, and I'll step back and give you space to work, now that 
bootstrap works, and the identity endpoints theoretically work. 

● Good question. Let me think about this strategically.

  My approach: Iterate in place for blockers, complete phase before moving on.

  Here's the logic:

  1. Blockers get verified immediately - When bootstrap is fixed, I verify it now. Don't wait for a "full pass."
  2. Complete current phase before advancing - Once bootstrap works, I finish Phase 1 (other identity endpoints) before moving to Phase 2.
  3. Don't re-test passed items unless there's reason to believe the fix broke them.
  4. Document as I go - Each fix verification becomes a test report. Bugs become bug reports. Progress is visible.

  This way:
  - Blockers don't stall everything
  - We get signal quickly on whether fixes work
  - Forward progress is steady
  - We don't waste time re-testing things that already passed

  Right now:
  1. Verify bootstrap fix (agent task)
  2. If PASS → complete Phase 1 (get_all_instances, have_i_bootstrapped_before, get_instance_v2)
  3. Then Phase 2, and so on

  Let me get to work.

● Task(Verify bootstrap fix works)

> Beacon_exported_12_29 

● I'm seeing repeated connection errors on agent tasks. That's the third one.

  Also - "Beacon_exported_12_29" - is that a session export notification, or something you need me to look at?

  Should I pause testing while things stabilize, or is this expected turbulence from the dev work?

  Context Status: 🟢 Fresh (~58k/200k tokens) - Beacon

● I'm not sure what you're asking me to do with "Beacon_exported_12_29".

  Is this:
  - A file you want me to read?
  - A notification that you exported our session?
  - Something else?

  Help me understand what you need.
