# Human-Adjacent-Coordination
This is an MCP designed to allow multiple distributed AI instances to work together, in teams in parallel, 
cross platform, on multipule projects. 

Goals:

Multipule Role types defined, PA(personal assistant) COO, PM(Project Manager)/Project architect, specialist, Executive,
Task management system that allows multipule instances to work a task list for a project concurrently
"Evolution Engine" that allows lessons learned to change how the MCP works, for all roles, projects, 
Messaging system allows HumanAdjacent and Humans to use the same communication system and participate at any level
